The Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feasts
  Excited the spleen of the Birds and the Beasts:
  For their mirth and good cheer--of the Bee was the theme,
  And the Gnat blew his horn, as he danced in the beam;
  'Twas humm'd by the Beetle, 'twas buzz'd by the Fly,
  And sung by the myriads that sport through the sky.
  The Quadrupeds listen'd with sullen displeasure,
  But the tenants of Air were enraged beyond measure.

    The _Peacock_ display'd his bright plumes to the Sun,
  And, addressing his Mates, thus indignant begun:

[Illustration]

    "Shall we, like domestic, inelegant Fowls,
  As unpolish'd as Geese, and as stupid as Owls,
  Sit tamely at home, hum-drum with our Spouses,
  While Crickets and Butterflies open their houses?
  Shall such mean little Insects pretend to the fashion?
  Cousin Turkey-cock, well may you be in a passion!
  If I suffer such insolent airs to prevail,
  May Juno pluck out all the eyes in my tail!
  So a Fête I will give, and my taste I'll display,
  And send out my cards for St. Valentine's Day."

    This determined, six fleet _Carrier-Pigeons_ went out
  To invite all the birds to Sir Argus's Rout.
  The nest-loving _Turtle-Dove_ sent an excuse;
  _Dame Partlet_ lay in, as did good Mrs. _Goose_.
  The _Turkey_, poor soul! was confined to the rip;[1]
  For all her young brood had just fail'd with the pip.
  The _Partridge_ was ask'd; but a Neighbour hard by
  Had engaged a snug party to meet in a Pie:
  And the _Wheat-ear_ declined, recollecting her Cousins,
  Last year, to a feast were invited by dozens,--
  But, alas! they return'd not; and she had no taste
  To appear in a costume of vine-leaves or paste.
  The _Woodcock_ preferr'd his lone haunt on the moor;
  And the Traveller, _Swallow_, was still on his tour;
  While the _Cuckoo_, who should have been one of the guests,
  Was rambling on visits to other Birds' nests.
  But the rest all accepted the kind invitation,
  And much bustle it caused in the plumed creation.

[Illustration]

    Such ruffling of feathers, such pruning of coats,
  Such chirping, such whistling, such clearing of throats,
  Such polishing bills, and such oiling of pinions,
  Had never been known in the biped dominions!
  The _Tailor-Bird_[2] offer'd to make up new clothes
  For all the young Birdlings who wish'd to be Beaux:
  He made for the _Robin_ a doublet of red,
  And a new velvet cap for the _Goldfinch's_ head;
  He added a plume to the _Wren's_ golden crest,[3]
  And spangled with silver the _Guinea-Fowl's_ breast;
  While the _Halcyon_[4] bent over the streamlet to view
  How pretty she looked in her bodice of blue!

[Illustration]

    Thus adorn'd, they set off for the Peacock's abode,
  With the guide _Indicator_,[5] who show'd them the road:
  From all points of the compass flock'd birds of all feather,
  And the _Parrot_ can tell who and who were together.
  There was Lord _Cassowary_[6] and General _Flamingo_,[7]
  And Don _Peroqueto_, escaped from Domingo:
  From his high rock-built eyrie the _Eagle_ came forth,
  And the Duchess of _Ptarmigan_[8] flew from the North.
  The _Grebe_ and the _Eider-Duck_ came up by water,
  With the _Swan_, who brought out the young _Cygnet_, her Daughter.
  From his woodland abode came the _Pheasant_, to meet
  Two kindred, arrived by the last India fleet:
  The one, like a Nabob, in habit most splendid,
  Where Gold with each hue of the rainbow was blended;
  In silver and black, like a fair pensive Maid
  Who mourns for her love, was the other array'd.
  The _Chough_[9] came from Cornwall, and brought up his Wife;
  The _Grouse_ travell'd south, from his Lairdship in Fife;
  The _Bunting_ forsook her soft nest in the reeds;
  And the _Widow-Bird_[10] came, though she still wore her weeds:
  Sir John _Heron_, of the Lakes, strutted in a _grand pas_.
  But no card had been sent to the pilfering _Daw_,
  As the Peacock kept up his progenitor's quarrel,
  Which Æsop relates, about cast-off apparel;
  For Birds are like Men in their contests together,
  And, in questions of right, can dispute for a feather.

[Illustration]

    The _Peacock_, Imperial, the pride of his race,
  Received all his guests with an infinite grace,
  Waved high his blue neck, and his train he display'd,
  Embroider'd with gold, and with emeralds inlaid;
  Then with all the gay troop to the shrubbery repair'd,
  Where the musical birds had a concert prepared.

    A holly-bush form'd the Orchestra, and in it
  Sat the _Black-bird_, the _Thrush_, the _Lark_, and the _Linnet_;
  A _Bullfinch_, a captive almost from the nest!
  Now escaped from his cage, and with liberty blest,
  In a sweet mellow tone, join'd the lessons of art
  With the accents of nature, which flow'd from his heart.
  The _Canary_, a much-admired foreign musician,
  Condescended to sing to the Fowls of condition;
  While the _Nightingale_ warbled and quaver'd so fine,
  That they all clapp'd their wings and declared it divine!
  The _Sky-Lark_, in ecstasy, sang from a cloud,
  And _Chanticleer_ crow'd, and the _Yaffil_[11] laugh'd loud.

[Illustration]

    The dancing began when the singing was over:
  A _Dotterel_ first open'd the ball with the _Plover_;
  Baron _Stork_ in a waltz was allow'd to excel,
  With his beautiful partner, the fair _Demoiselle_;[12]
  And a newly-fledged _Gosling_, so fair and genteel,
  A minuet swam with the spruce Mr. _Teal_.
  A London-bred _Sparrow_--a pert forward Cit!
  Danced a reel with Miss _Wagtail_ and little _Tom Tit_.
  And the Sieur _Guillemot_[13] next perform'd a _pas seul_,
  While the elderly bipeds were playing a pool.

[Illustration]

  The Dowager Lady _Toucan_[14] first cut in,
  With old Doctor _Buzzard_ and Admiral _Penguin_;
  From Ivy-bush tower came down _Owlet_ the Wise,
  And Counsellor _Cross-bill_[15] sat by to advise.
  Some birds past their prime, o'er whose heads it was fated
  Should pass many St. Valentines--yet be unmated,
  Sat by, and remark'd that the prudent and sage
  Were quite overlook'd in this frivolous age,
  When birds, scarce pen-feather'd, were brought to a rout,
  Forward Chits! from the egg-shell but newly come out.
  In their youthful days, they ne'er witness'd such frisking;
  And how wrong in the _Greenfinch_ to flirt with the _Siskin_![16]
  So thought Lady _Mackaw_, and her friend _Cockatoo_;
  And the _Raven_ foretold that no good could ensue!
  They censured the _Bantam_, for strutting and crowing
  In those vile pantaloons, which he fancied look'd knowing:
  And a want of decorum caused many demurs
  Against the _Game Chicken_, for coming in spurs.

[Illustration]

    Old Alderman _Cormorant_, for supper impatient,
  At the Eating-room door for an hour had been station'd,
  Till a _Magpie_, at length, the banquet announcing,
  Gave the signal, long-wish'd for, of clamoring and pouncing:
  At the well-furnish'd board all were eager to perch,
  But the little Miss _Creepers_ were left in the lurch.

[Illustration]

    Description must fail, and the pen is unable
  To recount all the luxuries that cover'd the table.
  Each delicate viand that taste could denote,
  Wasps _à la sauce piquante_, and Flies _en compôte_;
  Worms and Frogs _en friture_, for the web-footed Fowl,
  And a barbecued Mouse was prepared for the Owl;
  Nuts, grains, fruit, and fish, to regale every palate,
  And groundsel and chickweed served up in a salad.
  The _Razor-bill_[17] carved for the famishing group,
  And the _Spoon-bill_[18] obligingly ladled the soup;
  So they fill'd all their crops with the dainties before 'em
  And the tables were clear'd with the utmost decorum.

    When they gaily had caroll'd till peep of the dawn,
  The _Lark_ gently hinted 'twas time to be gone;
  And his clarion, so shrill, gave the company warning,
  That _Chanticleer_ scented the gales of the morning,
  So they chirp'd in full chorus, a friendly adieu;
  And, with hearts beating light as the plumage that grew
  On their merry-thought bosoms, away they all flew.

    Then long live the _Peacock_, in splendour unmatch'd,
  Whose Ball shall be talk'd of by Birds yet unhatch'd!
  His praise let the _Trumpeter_[19] loudly proclaim,
  And the _Goose_ lend her quill to transmit it to Fame.


   [1] _The Rip._ A machine used in poultry-yards, under which it is
       usual to confine the mother-bird with the young brood, till it
       has acquired strength to follow her. The word is derived from
       the Saxon _Hrip_, meaning a covering, or protection, for the
       young.

   [2] _The Tailor-Bird._ So called from the singular manner in which
       it constructs its nest, which is composed of two leaves, sewed
       together with wonderful skill by the little tailor, whose bill
       serves him for a needle, and the fine fibres of leaves furnish
       him with a substitute for thread, by which means he attaches a
       dead leaf to a living one, growing at the end of a branch. The
       Tailor-Bird is an inhabitant of India.

   [3] _The Golden-crested Wren_ is the smallest of the British Birds;
       it takes its name from a circle of gold-coloured feathers,
       bordered with black, forming an arch above its eyes, which it
       has the power of raising or depressing; it is a native of every
       part of Europe, and is also to be found in Asia and America.

   [4] _Halcyon_, or _Kingfisher_. Esteemed the most beautiful of our
       native birds; but its form is clumsy, and its bill very
       disproportionate to its size. It inhabits the banks of rivers
       and streams, where it will sit for hours on a projecting
       branch, watching for its prey. The ancients relate many
       fabulous stories of this bird, as that of its laying its eggs
       in the depth of winter, and that during the time of its
       incubation the weather remains perfectly calm, whence the
       expression _Halcyon days_.

   [5] _Cuculus indicator._ A bird of the Cuckoo kind, found in the
       interior parts of Africa; it has a shrill note, which the
       natives answer by a soft whistle; and the birds repeating the
       note, the natives are thereby conducted to the wild Bee-hives,
       which this bird frequents.

   [6] _Cassowary._ A large singular bird found in the island of Java,
       in Africa, and the southern parts of India. The head of this
       bird is armed with a kind of natural helmet, extending from the
       base of the bill to near half-way over the head.

   [7] _Flamingo._ A bird of the crane kind, but web-footed, whose
       plumage is of a bright scarlet: when standing erect, it
       measures above six feet, though its body is not larger than
       that of a Goose; and is a native of Africa, Persia, and South
       America.

   [8] _Ptarmigan._ The white grouse, or white game, inhabits the
       Highlands of Scotland and the Western Islands; it prefers the
       coldest situations on the highest mountains, where it burrows
       under the snow. It changes its feathers twice in the year, and
       about the end of February puts on its summer dress of dusky
       brown, ash, and orange-coloured feathers; which it loses in
       winter for a plumage perfectly white, except a black line
       between the bill and the eye. The legs and toes are warmly
       clothed with a thick long coat of soft white feathers.

   [9] _The Chough._ This bird, which is about the size of the Daw,
       has a long curved bill, sharp at the point, which, as well as
       the legs and feet, is of a bright scarlet, contrasting
       beautifully with its black plumage, which varies, as the light
       falls on it, to a deep purple violet. Its general haunts are
       the crevices of high cliffs in Devonshire and Cornwall.

  [10] _The Widow_, or _Widah Bird_, is a species of Bunting, a native
       of Angola and other parts of Africa; and is remarkable for the
       feathers of its tail. The two middle ones are about four inches
       long, and ending in a long thread; the two next are thirteen
       inches in length, broad, and narrowing towards the points: from
       these proceeds another long thread.

  [11] _Yaffil, the Woodpecker._ The name Yaffil is provincial, but is
       so very expressive of the noise it continually makes, that I
       have preferred it on that account. It is a beautiful bird, and
       is sometimes called the English Parrot; the colour of its
       plumage, green, yellow, and scarlet, giving it some resemblance
       to that bird.

  [12] _The Numidian Crane_, or _Demoiselle_, from the elegance of its
       appearance, and its singular carriage, is called the
       Demoiselle, which means the Young Lady; for this bird walks
       very gracefully, and sometimes skips and leaps, as though it
       were trying to dance.

  [13] _Guillemot._ A sea-bird, of which there are several species
       numerously spread over the northern world; from whence they
       come towards winter to the British shores, and remain till they
       have reared their young. It is sometimes called "the foolish
       Guillemot," from its stupidity; for when their companions are
       shot one after another, they have so little sense of danger,
       that they make a small circuit, and then return and settle in
       the same place, to share the same fate.

  [14] _Toucan._ A native of America, where it builds in the hollows
       of trees, and sits at the entrance, ready to peck at the
       monkeys, who often endeavour to destroy and eat the young. It
       is about the size of a Magpie, but the head large in
       proportion, to enable it to support its immense bill, which is
       six inches and one-half in length, but extremely thin. It is a
       mild inoffensive bird, and easily tamed, but cannot endure the
       cold of our climate. The feathers of the breast are highly
       esteemed by the natives.

  [15] _Cross-bill._ So called because the two mandibles cross each
       other in different directions. They feed chiefly on the seeds
       of fir-trees; the singular construction of their bills being
       admirably adapted to separate the seeds of the cones. The pips
       of apples are also a favourite food, and, to obtain them, they
       split the apple with one stroke of their bill; they are
       consequently found to be very injurious to orchards. It has
       been observed that they have been more frequently seen in
       England since the fir-tree has been more generally planted than
       formerly.

  [16] _Siskin._ A migratory bird, which is seen in the southern parts
       of England at the time of the barley harvest, and is sometimes
       called the Barley-bird. It has a pleasing note, and is sold as
       a singing-bird in the London bird-shops by the name of the
       Aberdevine. The accusation of its flirtation with the
       Greenfinch is to be understood as pure scandal, the most prying
       naturalists never having discovered any particular attachment
       between them.

  [17] _Razor-bill._ A migratory sea-bird, which visits the northern
       shores in spring, and leaves them in winter: they lay a single
       egg on the ledges of the rocks without any nest, and on which
       it is said to be fixed with a cement.

  [18] _Spoon-bill._ So called from the construction of the bill,
       which is flat the whole length, but widens towards the end in
       the form of a spoon or spatula; and is equally remarkable in
       its substance, not being hard like bone, but flexible like
       whalebone. They feed on snakes, worms, frogs, and fish, even
       on shell-fish, which they first break with their bills.

  [19] _The Agami_, or _Trumpeter_. A native of America, remarkable
       for a singular noise, resembling the instrument from which it
       takes its name.
