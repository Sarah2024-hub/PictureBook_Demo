birds' nests   but the rest all accepted the kind invitation   and much bustle it caused in the plumed creation        such ruffling of feathers such pruning of coats   such chirping such whistling such clearing of throats   such polishing bills and such oiling of pinions   had never been known in the biped dominions   the tailor-bird[2] offer'd to make up new clothes   for all the young birdlings who wish'd to be beaux    he made for the robin a doublet of red   and a new velvet cap for the goldfinch's head   he added a plume to the wren's golden crest[3]   and spangled with silver

cockatoo   and the raven foretold that no good could ensue   they censured the bantam for strutting and crowing   in those vile pantaloons which he fancied look'd knowing    and a want of decorum

towards winter to the british shores and remain till they        have reared their young it is sometimes called the foolish        guillemot from its stupidity for when their companions are
