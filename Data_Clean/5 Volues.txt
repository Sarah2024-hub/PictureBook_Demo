"[illustration  several of the children were growing out of their clothes]  there was once a king and he had a queen and he was the manliest of his sex and she was the loveliest of hers the king was in his private profession under government the queen's father had been a medical man out of town  they had nineteen children and were always having more seventeen of these children took care of the baby and alicia the eldest took care of them all their ages varied from seven years to seven months  let us now resume our story  one day the king was going to the office when he stopped at the fishmonger's to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail which the queen who was a careful housekeeper had requested him to send home mr pickles the fishmonger said certainly sir is there any other article good-morning  the king went on towards the office in a melancholy mood for quarter day was such a long way off and several of the dear children were growing out of their clothes he had not proceeded far when mr pickles's errand-boy came running after him and said sir you didn't notice the old lady in our shop  what old lady enquired the king i saw none  now the king had not seen any old lady because this old lady had been invisible to him though visible to mr pickles's boy probably because he messed and splashed the water about to that degree and flopped the pairs of soles down in that violent manner that if she had not been visible to him he would have spoilt her clothes  just then the old lady came trotting up she was dressed in shot-silk of the richest quality smelling of dried lavender  king watkins the first i believe said the old lady  watkins replied the king is my name  papa if i am not mistaken of the beautiful princess alicia said the old lady  and of eighteen other darlings replied the king  listen you are going to the office said the old lady  it instantly flashed upon the king that she must be a fairy or how could she know that  you are right said the old lady answering his thoughts i am the good fairy grandmarina attend when you return home to dinner politely invite the princess alicia to have some of the salmon you bought just now  it may disagree with her said the king  the old lady became so very angry at this absurd idea that the king was quite alarmed and humbly begged her pardon  we hear a great deal too much about this thing disagreeing and that thing disagreeing said the old lady with the greatest contempt it was possible to express don't be greedy i think you want it all yourself  the king hung his head under this reproof and said he wouldn't talk about things disagreeing any more  be good then said the fairy grandmarina and don't when the beautiful princess alicia consents to partake of the salmon as i think she will you will find she will leave a fish-bone on her plate tell her to dry it and to rub it and to polish it till it shines like mother-of-pearl and to take care of it as a present from me  is that all asked the king  don't be impatient sir returned the fairy grandmarina scolding him severely don't catch people short before they have done speaking just the way with you grown-up persons you are always doing it  the king again hung his head and said he wouldn't do so any more  be good then said the fairy grandmarina and don't tell the princess alicia with my love that the fish-bone is a magic present which can only be used once but that it will bring her that once whatever she wishes for provided she wishes for it at the right time that is the message take care of it  [illustration  hoity toity me]  the king was beginning might i ask the reason  when the fairy became absolutely furious  will you be good sir she exclaimed stamping her foot on the ground the reason for this and the reason for that indeed you are always wanting the reason no reason there hoity toity me i am sick of your grown-up reasons  the king was extremely frightened by the old lady's flying into such a passion and said he was very sorry to have offended her and he wouldn't ask for reasons any more  be good then said the old lady and don't  with those words grandmarina vanished and the king went on and on and on till he came to the office there he wrote and wrote and wrote till it was time to go home again then he politely invited the princess alicia as the fairy had directed him to partake of the salmon and when she had enjoyed it very much he saw the fish-bone on her plate as the fairy had told him he would and he delivered the fairy's message and the princess alicia took care to dry the bone and to rub it and to polish it till it shone like mother-of-pearl  [illustration  he saw the fish-bone on her plate]  and so when the queen was going to get up in the morning she said o dear me dear me my head my head and then she fainted away  the princess alicia who happened to be looking in at the chamber-door asking about breakfast was very much alarmed when she saw her royal mamma in this state and she rang the bell for peggy which was the name of the lord chamberlain but remembering where the smelling-bottle was she climbed on a chair and got it and after that she climbed on another chair by the bedside and held the smelling-bottle to the queen's nose and after that she jumped down and got some water and after that she jumped up again and wetted the queen's forehead and in short when the lord chamberlain came in that dear old woman said to the little princess what a trot you are i couldn't have done it better myself    but that was not the worst of the good queen's illness o no she was very ill indeed for a long time the princess alicia kept the seventeen young princes and princesses quiet and dressed and undressed and danced the baby and made the kettle boil and heated the soup and swept the hearth and poured out the medicine and nursed the queen and did all that ever she could and was as busy busy busy as busy could be for there were not many servants at that palace for three reasons because the king was short of money because a rise in his office never seemed to come and because quarter day was so far off that it looked almost as far off and as little as one of the stars  but on the morning when the queen fainted away where was the magic fish-bone why there it was in the princess alicia's pocket she had almost taken it out to bring the queen to life again when she put it back and looked for the smelling-bottle  after the queen had come out of her swoon that morning and was dozing the princess alicia hurried up-stairs to tell a most particular secret to a most particularly confidential friend of hers who was a duchess people did suppose her to be a doll but she was really a duchess though nobody knew it except the princess    this most particular secret was a secret about the magic fish-bone the history of which was well known to the duchess because the princess told her everything the princess kneeled down by the bed on which the duchess was lying full-dressed and wide awake and whispered the secret to her the duchess smiled and nodded people might have supposed that she never smiled and nodded but she often did though nobody knew it except the princess  then the princess alicia hurried downstairs again to keep watch in the queen's room she often kept watch by herself in the queen's room but every evening while the illness lasted she sat there watching with the king and every evening the king sat looking at her with a cross look wondering why she never brought out the magic fish-bone as often as she noticed this she ran up-stairs whispered the secret to the duchess over again and said to the duchess besides they think we children never have a reason or a meaning and the duchess though the most fashionable duchess that ever was heard of winked her eye  alicia said the king one evening when she wished him good night  yes papa  what is become of the magic fish-bone  in my pocket papa  i thought you had lost it  o no papa  or forgotten it  no indeed papa  and so another time the dreadful little snapping pug-dog next door made a rush at one of the young princes as he stood on the steps coming home from school and terrified him out of his wits and he put his hand through a pane of glass and bled bled bled when the seventeen other young princes and princesses saw him bleed bleed bleed they were terrified out of their wits too and screamed themselves black in their seventeen faces all at once but the princess alicia put her hands over all their seventeen mouths one after another and persuaded them to be quiet because of the sick queen and then she put the wounded prince's hand in a basin of fresh cold water while they stared with their twice seventeen are thirty-four put down four and carry three eyes and then she looked in the hand for bits of glass and there were fortunately no bits of glass there and then she said to two chubby-legged princes who were sturdy though small bring me in the royal rag-bag i must snip and stitch and cut and contrive so those two young princes tugged at the royal rag-bag and lugged it in and the princess alicia sat down on the floor with a large pair of scissors and a needle and thread and snipped and stitched and cut and contrived and made a bandage and put it on and it fitted beautifully and so when it was all done she saw the king her papa looking on by the door    alicia  yes papa  what have you been doing  snipping stitching cutting and contriving papa  where is the magic fish-bone  in my pocket papa  i thought you had lost it  o no papa  or forgotten it  no indeed papa  after that she ran up-stairs to the duchess and told her what had passed and told her the secret over again and the duchess shook her flaxen curls and laughed with her rosy lips    well and so another time the baby fell under the grate the seventeen young princes and princesses were used to it for they were almost always falling under the grate or down the stairs but the baby was not used to it yet and it gave him a swelled face and a black eye the way the poor little darling came to tumble was that he slid out of the princess alicia's lap just as she was sitting in a great coarse apron that quite smothered her in front of the kitchen-fire beginning to peel the turnips for the broth for dinner and the way she came to be doing that was that the king's cook had run away that morning with her own true love who was a very tall but very tipsy soldier then the seventeen young princes and princesses who cried at everything that happened cried and roared but the princess alicia who couldn't help crying a little herself quietly called to them to be still on account of not throwing back the queen up-stairs who was fast getting well and said hold your tongues you wicked little monkeys every one of you while i examine baby then she examined baby and found that he hadn't broken anything and she held cold iron to his poor dear eye and smoothed his poor dear face and he presently fell asleep in her arms then she said to the seventeen princes and princesses i am afraid to lay him down yet lest he should wake and feel pain be good and you shall all be cooks they jumped for joy when they heard that and began making themselves cooks' caps out of old newspapers so to one she gave the salt-box and to one she gave the barley and to one she gave the herbs and to one she gave the turnips and to one she gave the carrots and to one she gave the onions and to one she gave the spice-box till they were all cooks and all running about at work she sitting in the middle smothered in the great coarse apron nursing baby by and by the broth was done and the baby woke up smiling like an angel and was trusted to the sedatest princess to hold while the other princes and princesses were squeezed into a far-off corner to look at the princess alicia turning out the saucepan-full of broth for fear as they were always getting into trouble they should get splashed and scalded when the broth came tumbling out steaming beautifully and smelling like a nosegay good to eat they clapped their hands that made the baby clap his hands and that and his looking as if he had a comic toothache made all the princes and princesses laugh so the princess alicia said laugh and be good and after dinner we will make him a nest on the floor in a corner and he shall sit in his nest and see a dance of eighteen cooks that delighted the young princes and princesses and they ate up all the broth and washed up all the plates and dishes and cleared away and pushed the table into a corner and then they in their cooks' caps and the princess alicia in the smothering coarse apron that belonged to the cook that had run away with her own true love that was the very tall but very tipsy soldier danced a dance of eighteen cooks before the angelic baby who forgot his swelled face and his black eye and crowed with joy  [illustration  the dance of the eighteen cooks]  and so then once more the princess alicia saw king watkins the first her father standing in the doorway looking on and he said  what have you been doing alicia  cooking and contriving papa  what else have you been doing alicia  keeping the children light-hearted papa  where is the magic fish-bone alicia  in my pocket papa  i thought you had lost it  o no papa  or forgotten it  no indeed papa  the king then sighed so heavily and seemed so low-spirited and sat down so miserably leaning his head upon his hand and his elbow upon the kitchen table pushed away in the corner that the seventeen princes and princesses crept softly out of the kitchen and left him alone with the princess alicia and the angelic baby  what is the matter papa  i am dreadfully poor my child  have you no money at all papa  [illustration  what is the matter papa]  none my child  is there no way left of getting any papa  no way said the king i have tried very hard and i have tried all ways  when she heard those last words the princess alicia began to put her hand into the pocket where she kept the magic fish-bone  papa said she when we have tried very hard and tried all ways we must have done our very very best  no doubt alicia  when we have done our very very best papa and that is not enough then i think the right time must have come for asking help of others this was the very secret connected with the magic fish-bone which she had found out for herself from the good fairy grandmarina's words and which she had so often whispered to her beautiful and fashionable friend the duchess  so she took out of her pocket the magic fish-bone that had been dried and rubbed and polished till it shone like mother-of-pearl and she gave it one little kiss and wished it was quarter day and immediately it was quarter day and the king's quarter's salary came rattling down the chimney and bounced into the middle of the floor  but this was not half of what happened no not a quarter for immediately afterwards the good fairy grandmarina came riding in in a carriage and four peacocks with mr pickles's boy up behind dressed in silver and gold with a cocked hat powdered hair pink silk stockings a jewelled cane and a nosegay down jumped mr pickles's boy with his cocked hat in his hand and wonderfully polite being entirely changed by enchantment and handed grandmarina out and there she stood in her rich shot silk smelling of dried lavender fanning herself with a sparkling fan  alicia my dear said this charming old fairy how do you do i hope i see you pretty well give me a kiss  the princess alicia embraced her and then grandmarina turned to the king and said rather sharply  are you good  [illustration  alicia my dear  how do you do]  the king said he hoped so  i suppose you know the reason now why my god-daughter here kissing the princess again did not apply to the fish-bone sooner said the fairy  the king made her a shy bow  ah but you didn't then said the fairy  the king made her a shyer bow  any more reasons to ask for said the fairy  the king said no and he was very sorry  be good then said the fairy and live happy ever afterwards  then grandmarina waved her fan and the queen came in most splendidly dressed and the seventeen young princes and princesses no longer grown out of their clothes came in newly fitted out from top to toe with tucks in everything to admit of its being let out after that the fairy tapped the princess alicia with her fan and the smothering coarse apron flew away and she appeared exquisitely dressed like a little bride with a wreath of orange-flowers and a silver veil after that the kitchen dresser changed of itself into a wardrobe made of beautiful woods and gold and looking glass which was full of dresses of all sorts all for her and all exactly fitting her after that the angelic baby came in running alone with his face and eye not a bit the worse but much the better then grandmarina begged to be introduced to the duchess and when the duchess was brought down many compliments passed between them  a little whispering took place between the fairy and the duchess and then the fairy said out loud yes i thought she would have told you grandmarina then turned to the king and queen and said we are going in search of prince certainpersonio the pleasure of your company is requested at church in half an hour precisely so she and the princess alicia got into the carriage and mr pickles's boy handed in the duchess who sat by herself on the opposite seat and then mr pickles's boy put up the steps and got up behind and the peacocks flew away with their tails spread  [illustration  she appeared exquisitely dressed like a little bride]  prince certainpersonio was sitting by himself eating barley-sugar and waiting to be ninety when he saw the peacocks followed by the carriage coming in at the window it immediately occurred to him that something uncommon was going to happen  prince said grandmarina i bring you your bride  the moment the fairy said those words prince certainpersonio's face left off being stickey and his jacket and corduroys changed to peach-bloom velvet and his hair curled and a cap and feather flew in like a bird and settled on his head he got into the carriage by the fairy's invitation and there he renewed his acquaintance with the duchess whom he had seen before  in the church were the prince's relations and friends and the princess alicia's relations and friends and the seventeen princes and princesses and the baby and a crowd of the neighbours the marriage was beautiful beyond expression the duchess was bridesmaid and beheld the ceremony from the pulpit where she was supported by the cushion of the desk  grandmarina gave a magnificent wedding feast afterwards in which there was everything and more to eat and everything and more to drink the wedding cake was delicately ornamented with white satin ribbons frosted silver and white lilies and was forty-two yards round  when grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple and prince certainpersonio had made a speech and everybody had cried hip hip hip hurrah grandmarina announced to the king and queen that in future there would be eight quarter days in every year except in leap year when there would be ten she then turned to certainpersonio and alicia and said my dears you will have thirty-five children and they will all be good and beautiful seventeen of your children will be boys and eighteen will be girls the hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally they will never have the measles and will have recovered from the whooping-cough before being born  on hearing such good news everybody cried out hip hip hip hurrah again  it only remains said grandmarina in conclusion to make an end of the fish-bone  so she took it from the hand of the princess alicia and it instantly flew down the throat of the dreadful little snapping pug-dog next door and choked him and he expired in convulsions"@"TheMagicFishbone"@"CharlesDickens"
"foreword   the story contained herein was written by charles dickens in 1867 it is the third of four stories entitled holiday romance and was published originally in a children's magazine in america it purports to be written by a child aged nine it was republished in england in all the year round in 1868 for this and four other christmas pieces dickens received £1000  holiday romance was published in book form by messrs chapman & hall in 1874 with edwin drood and other stories  for this reprint the text of the story as it appeared in all the year round has been followed     captain boldheart and the latin-grammar master   the subject of our present narrative would appear to have devoted himself to the pirate profession at a comparatively early age we find him in command of a splendid schooner of one hundred guns loaded to the muzzle 'ere yet he had had a party in honour of his tenth birthday  it seems that our hero considering himself spited by a latin-grammar-master demanded the satisfaction due from one man of honour to another not getting it he privately withdrew his haughty spirit from such low company bought a second-hand pocket-pistol folded up some sandwiches in a paper bag made a bottle of spanish liquorice-water and entered on a career of valour  it were tedious to follow boldheart for such was his name through the commencing stages of his history suffice it that we find him bearing the rank of captain boldheart reclining in full uniform on a crimson hearth-rug spread out upon the quarter-deck of his schooner the beauty in the china seas it was a lovely evening and as his crew lay grouped about him he favoured them with the following melody o landsmen are folly o pirates are jolly o diddleum dolly di chorus heave yo  the soothing effect of these animated sounds floating over the waters as the common sailors united their rough voices to take up the rich tones of boldheart may be more easily conceived than described  it was under these circumstances that the lookout at the masthead gave the word whales  all was now activity  where away cried captain boldheart starting up  on the larboard bow sir replied the fellow at the masthead touching his hat for such was the height of discipline on board of the beauty that even at that height he was obliged to mind it or be shot through the head  [illustration  his crew lay grouped around him]  this adventure belongs to me said boldheart boy my harpoon let no man follow and leaping alone into his boat the captain rowed with admirable dexterity in the direction of the monster  all was now excitement  he nears him said an elderly seaman following the captain through his spy-glass  he strikes him said another seaman a mere stripling but also with a spy-glass  he tows him towards us said another seaman a man in the full vigour of life but also with a spy-glass  in fact the captain was seen approaching with the huge bulk following we will not dwell on the deafening cries of boldheart boldheart with which he was received when carelessly leaping on the quarter-deck he presented his prize to his men they afterwards made two thousand four hundred and seventeen pound ten and sixpence by it  ordering the sails to be braced up the captain now stood wnw the beauty flew rather than floated over the dark blue waters nothing particular occurred for a fortnight except taking with considerable slaughter four spanish galleons and a snow from south america all richly laden inaction began to tell upon the spirits of the men captain boldheart called all hands aft and said   my lads i hear there are discontented ones among ye let any such stand forth  after some murmuring in which the expressions aye aye sir union jack avast starboard port bowsprit and similar indications of a mutinous undercurrent though subdued were audible bill boozey captain of the foretop came out from the rest his form was that of a giant but he quailed under the captain's eye  what are your wrongs said the captain  why d'ye see captain boldheart replied the towering mariner i've sailed man and boy for many a year but i never yet know'd the milk served out for the ship's company's teas to be so sour as 'tis aboard this craft  [illustration  the rescue of william boozey]  at this moment the thrilling cry man overboard announced to the astonished crew that boozey in stepping back as the captain in mere thoughtfulness laid his hand upon the faithful pocket-pistol which he wore in his belt had lost his balance and was struggling with the foaming tide  all was now stupefaction  but with captain boldheart to throw off his uniform coat regardless of the various rich orders with which it was decorated and to plunge into the sea after the drowning giant was the work of a moment maddening was the excitement when boats were lowered intense the joy when the captain was seen holding up the drowning man with his teeth deafening the cheering when both were restored to the main deck of the beauty and from the instant of his changing his wet clothes for dry ones captain boldheart had no such devoted though humble friend as william boozey  boldheart now pointed to the horizon and called the attention of his crew to the taper spars of a ship lying snug in harbour under the guns of a fort  she shall be ours at sunrise said he serve out a double allowance of grog and prepare for action  all was now preparation  when morning dawned after a sleepless night it was seen that the stranger was crowding on all sail to come out of the harbour and offer battle as the two ships came nearer to each other the stranger fired a gun and hoisted roman colours boldheart then perceived her to be the latin-grammar-master's bark such indeed she was and had been tacking about the world in unavailing pursuit from the time of his first taking to a roving life  boldheart now addressed his men promising to blow them up if he should feel convinced that their reputation required it and giving orders that the latin-grammar-master should be taken alive he then dismissed them to their quarters and the fight began with a broadside from the beauty she then veered round and poured in another the scorpion so was the bark of the latin-grammar-master appropriately called was not slow to return her fire and a terrific cannonading ensued in which the guns of the beauty did tremendous execution  the latin-grammar-master was seen upon the poop in the midst of the smoke and fire encouraging his men to do him justice he was no craven though his white hat his short grey trousers and his long snuff-coloured surtout reaching to his heels the self-same coat in which he had spited boldheart contrasted most unfavourably with the brilliant uniform of the latter at this moment boldheart seizing a pike and putting himself at the head of his men gave the word to board  a desperate conflict ensued in the hammock nettings or somewhere in about that direction until the latin-grammar-master having all his masts gone his hull and rigging shot through and through and seeing boldheart slashing a path towards him hauled down his flag himself gave up his sword to boldheart and asked for quarter scarce had he been put into the captain's boat 'ere the scorpion went down with all on board  on captain boldheart's now assembling his men a circumstance occurred he found it necessary with one blow of his cutlass to kill the cook who having lost his brother in the late action was making at the latin-grammar-master in an infuriated state intent on his destruction with a carving-knife  captain boldheart then turned to the latin-grammar-master severely reproaching him with his perfidy and put it to his crew what they considered that a master who spited a boy deserved  they answered with one voice death  it may be so said the captain but it shall never be said that boldheart stained his hour of triumph with the blood of his enemy prepare the cutter  the cutter was immediately prepared  without taking your life said the captain i must yet for ever deprive you of the power of spiting other boys i shall turn you adrift in this boat you will find in her two oars a compass a bottle of rum a small cask of water a piece of pork a bag of biscuit and my latin grammar go and spite the natives if you can find any  deeply conscious of this bitter sarcasm the unhappy wretch was put into the cutter and was soon left far behind he made no effort to row but was seen lying on his back with his legs up when last made out by the ship's telescopes  a stiff breeze now beginning to blow captain boldheart gave orders to keep her ssw easing her a little during the night by falling off a point or two w by w or even by ws if she complained much he then retired for the night having in truth much need of repose in addition to the fatigues he had undergone this brave officer had received sixteen wounds in the engagement but had not mentioned it  in the morning a white squall came on and was succeeded by other squalls of various colours it thundered and lightened heavily for six weeks hurricanes then set in for two months waterspouts and tornadoes followed the oldest sailor on board and he was a very old one had never seen such weather the beauty lost all idea where she was and the carpenter reported six feet two of water in the hold everybody fell senseless at the pumps every day  provisions now ran very low our hero put the crew on short allowance and put himself on shorter allowance than any man in the ship but his spirit kept him fat in this extremity the gratitude of boozey the captain of the foretop whom our readers may remember was truly affecting the loving though lowly william repeatedly requested to be killed and preserved for the captain's table  we now approach a change in affairs  one day during a gleam of sunshine and when the weather had moderated the man at the masthead too weak now to touch his hat besides its having been blown away called out  savages  all was now expectation  presently fifteen hundred canoes each paddled by twenty savages were seen advancing in excellent order they were a light green colour the savages were and sang with great energy the following strain     choo a choo a choo tooth     muntch muntch nycey   choo a choo a choo tooth   muntch muntch nyce  as the shades of night were by this time closing in these expressions were supposed to embody this simple people's views of the evening hymn but it too soon appeared that the song was a translation of for what we are going to receive &c  the chief imposingly decorated with feathers of lively colours and having the majestic appearance of a fighting parrot no sooner understood he understood english perfectly that the ship was the beauty captain boldheart than he fell upon his face on the deck and could not be persuaded to rise until the captain had lifted him up & told him he wouldn't hurt him all the rest of the savages also fell on their faces with marks of terror and had also to be lifted up one by one thus the fame of the great boldheart had gone before him even among these children of nature  turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing numbers and on these and yams the people made a hearty meal after dinner the chief told captain boldheart that there was better feeding up at the village and that he would be glad to take him and his officers there apprehensive of treachery boldheart ordered his boat's crew to attend him completely armed and well were it for other commanders if their precautions but let us not anticipate  [illustration  arm-in-arm with the chief]  [illustration  two savages floured him before putting him to the fire]  when the canoes arrived at the beach the darkness of the night was illumined by the light of an immense fire ordering his boat's crew with the intrepid though illiterate william at their head to keep close and be upon their guard boldheart bravely went on arm-in-arm with the chief  but how to depict the captain's surprise when he found a ring of savages singing in chorus that barbarous translation of for what we are going to receive &c which has been given above and dancing hand-in-hand round the latin-grammar-master in a hamper with his head shaved while two savages floured him before putting him to the fire to be cooked  boldheart now took counsel with his officers on the course to be adopted in the mean time the miserable captive never ceased begging pardon and imploring to be delivered on the generous boldheart's proposal it was at length resolved that he should not be cooked but should be allowed to remain raw on two conditions namely       1 that he should never under any circumstances presume to teach      any boy any thing any more       2 that if taken back to england he should pass his life in      travelling to find out boys who wanted their exercises done and      should do their exercises for those boys for nothing and never say      a word about it  drawing his sword from its sheath boldheart swore him to these conditions on its shining blade the prisoner wept bitterly and appeared acutely to feel the errors of his past career  the captain then ordered his boat's crew to make ready for a volley and after firing to re-load quickly and expect a score or two on ye to go head over heels murmured william boozey for i'm a looking at ye with those words the derisive though deadly william took a good aim  fire  the ringing voice of boldheart was lost in the report of the guns and the screeching of the savages volley after volley awakened the numerous echoes hundreds of savages were killed hundreds wounded and thousands ran howling into the woods the latin-grammar-master had a spare night-cap lent him and a longtail coat which he wore hind side before he presented a ludicrous though pitiable appearance and serve him right  [illustration  the latin-grammar-master had a spare nightcap lent him and a longtail coat which he wore hind side before]  [illustration  ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced  by the uncouth though agile william]  we now find captain boldheart with this rescued wretch on board standing off for other islands at one of these not a cannibal island but a pork and vegetable one he married only in fun on his part the king's daughter here he rested some time receiving from the natives great quantities of precious stones gold dust elephants' teeth and sandal wood and getting very rich this too though he almost every day made presents of enormous value to his men  the ship being at length as full as she could hold of all sorts of valuable things boldheart gave orders to weigh the anchor and turn the beauty's head towards england these orders were obeyed with three cheers and ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced on deck by the uncouth though agile william  we next find captain boldheart about three leagues off madeira surveying through his spy-glass a stranger of suspicious appearance making sail towards him on his firing a gun ahead of her to bring her to she ran up a flag which he instantly recognized as the flag from the mast in the back-garden at home  [illustration  married the chief's daughter]  inferring from this that his father had put to sea to seek his long-lost son the captain sent his own boat on board the stranger to inquire if this was so and if so whether his father's intentions were strictly honourable the boat came back with a present of greens and fresh meat and reported that the stranger was the family of twelve hundred tons and had not only the captain's father on board but also his mother with the majority of his aunts and uncles and all his cousins it was further reported to boldheart that the whole of these relations had expressed themselves in a becoming manner and were anxious to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit he had done them boldheart at once invited them to breakfast next morning on board the beauty and gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all day  it was in the course of the night that the captain discovered the hopelessness of reclaiming the latin-grammar-master that thankless traitor was found out as the two ships lay near each other communicating with the family by signals and offering to give up boldheart he was hanged at the yard-arm the first thing in the morning after having it impressively pointed out to him by boldheart that this was what spiters came to  the meeting between the captain and his parents was attended with tears his uncles and aunts would have attended their meeting with tears too but he wasn't going to stand that his cousins were very much astonished by the size of his ship and the discipline of his men and were greatly overcome by the splendour of his uniform he kindly conducted them round the vessel and pointed out every thing worthy of notice he also fired his hundred guns and found it amusing to witness their alarm  the entertainment surpassed everything ever seen on board ship and lasted from ten in the morning until seven the next morning only one disagreeable incident occurred captain boldheart found himself obliged to put his cousin tom in irons for being disrespectful on the boy's promising amendment however he was humanely released after a few hours' close confinement  boldheart now took his mother down into the great cabin and asked after the young lady with whom it was well known to the world he was in love his mother replied that the object of his affections was then at school at margate for the benefit of sea-bathing it was the month of september but that she feared the young lady's friends were still opposed to the union boldheart at once resolved if necessary to bombard the town  taking the command of his ship with this intention and putting all but fighting men on board the family with orders to that vessel to keep in company boldheart soon anchored in margate roads here he went ashore well-armed and attended by his boat's crew at their head the faithful though ferocious william and demanded to see the mayor who came out of his office  dost know the name of yon ship mayor asked boldheart fiercely  [illustration  dost know the name of yon ship mayor]  [illustration  standing sentry over him]  no said the mayor rubbing his eyes which he could scarce believe when he saw the goodly vessel riding at anchor  she is named the beauty said the captain  hah exclaimed the mayor with a start and you then are captain boldheart  the same  a pause ensued the mayor trembled  now mayor said the captain choose help me to my bride or be bombarded  the mayor begged for two hours' grace in which to make inquiries respecting the young lady boldheart accorded him but one and during that one placed william boozey sentry over him with a drawn sword and instructions to accompany him wherever he went and to run him through the body if he showed a sign of playing false  at the end of the hour the mayor re-appeared more dead than alive closely waited on by boozey more alive than dead  [illustration  his lovely bride came forth]  captain said the mayor i have ascertained that the young lady is going to bathe even now she waits her turn for a machine the tide is low though rising i in one of our town-boats shall not be suspected when she comes forth in her bathing-dress into the shallow water from behind the hood of the machine my boat shall intercept her and prevent her return do you the rest  mayor returned capt boldheart thou hast saved thy town  the captain then signalled his boat to take him off and steering her himself ordered her crew to row towards the bathing-ground and there to rest upon their oars all happened as had been arranged his lovely bride came forth the mayor glided in behind her she became confused and had floated out of her depth when with one skilful touch of the rudder and one quivering stroke from the boat's crew her adoring boldheart held her in his strong arms there her shrieks of terror were changed to cries of joy  before the beauty could get under weigh the hoisting of all the flags in the town and harbour and the ringing of all the bells announced to the brave boldheart that he had nothing to fear he therefore determined to be married on the spot and signalled for a clergyman and clerk who came off promptly in a sailing-boat named the skylark another great entertainment was then given on board the beauty in the midst of which the mayor was called out by a messenger he returned with the news that government had sent down to know whether captain boldheart in acknowledgment of the great services he had done his country by being a pirate would consent to be made a lieutenant-colonel for himself he would have spurned the worthless boon but his bride wished it and he consented  only one thing further happened before the good ship family was dismissed with rich presents to all on board it is painful to record but such is human nature in some cousins that captain boldheart's unmannerly cousin tom was actually tied up to receive three dozen with a rope's end for cheekyness and making games when captain boldheart's lady begged for him and he was spared the beauty then refitted and the captain and his bride departed for the indian ocean to enjoy themselves for

published in book form by messrs chapman & hall in 1874 with edwin drood and other stories  for this reprint the text of the story as it appeared in all the year round has been followed     the trial of william tinkling     this beginning-part is not made out of anybody's head you know it's real you must believe this beginning-part more than what comes after else you won't understand how what comes after came to be written you must believe it all but you must believe this most please i am the editor of it bob redforth he's my cousin and shaking the table on purpose wanted to be the editor of it but i said he shouldn't because he couldn't he has no idea of being an editor    nettie ashford is my bride we were married in the right-hand closet in the corner of the dancing-school where first we met with a ring a green one from wilkingwater's toy-shop i owed for it out of my pocket-money when the rapturous ceremony was over we all four went up the lane and let off a cannon brought loaded in bob redforth's waistcoat-pocket to announce our nuptials it flew right up when it went off and turned over next day lieutenant-colonel robin redforth was united with similar ceremonies to alice rainbird this time the cannon bust with a most terrific explosion and made a puppy bark  my peerless bride was at the period of which we now treat in captivity at miss grimmer's drowvey and grimmer is the partnership and opinion is divided which is the greatest beast the lovely bride of the colonel was also immured in the dungeons of the same establishment a vow was entered into between the colonel and myself that we would cut them out on the following wednesday when walking two and two  under the desperate circumstances of the case the active brain of the colonel combining with his lawless pursuit he is a pirate suggested an attack with fireworks this however from motives of humanity was abandoned as too expensive  lightly armed with a paper-knife buttoned up under his jacket and waving the dreaded black flag at the end of a cane the colonel took command of me at 2 pm on the eventful and appointed day he had drawn out the plan of attack on a piece of paper which was rolled up round a hoop-stick he showed it to me my position and my full-length portrait but my real ears don't stick out horizontal was behind a corner-lamp-post with written orders to remain there till i should see miss drowvey fall the drowvey who was to fall was the one in spectacles not the one with the large lavender bonnet at that signal i was to rush forth seize my bride and fight my way to the lane there a junction would be effected between myself and the colonel and putting our brides behind us between ourselves and the palings we were to conquer or die    [illustration  waving his black flag the colonel attacked]  the enemy appeared approached waving his black flag the colonel attacked confusion ensued anxiously i awaited my signal but my signal came not so far from falling the hated drowvey in spectacles appeared to me to have muffled the colonel's head in his outlawed banner and to be pitching into him with a parasol the one in the lavender bonnet also performed prodigies of valour with her fists on his back seeing that all was for the moment lost i fought my desperate way hand to hand to the lane through taking the back road i was so fortunate as to meet nobody and arrived there uninterrupted    it seemed an age ere the colonel joined me he had been to the jobbing-tailor's to be sewn up in several places and attributed our defeat to the refusal of the detested drowvey to fall finding her so obstinate he had said to her in a loud voice die recreant but had found her no more open to reason on that point than the other  my blooming bride appeared accompanied by the colonel's bride at the dancing-school next day what was her face averted from me hah even so with a look of scorn she put into my hand a bit of paper and took another partner on the paper was pencilled heavens can i write the word is my husband a cow  [illustration  sewn up in several places]  in the first bewilderment of my heated brain i tried to think what slanderer could have traced my family to the ignoble animal mentioned above vain were my endeavours at the end of that dance i whispered the colonel to come into the cloak-room and i showed him the note    there is a syllable wanting said he with a gloomy brow  hah what syllable was my inquiry  she asks can she write the word and no you see she couldn't said the colonel pointing out the passage  and the word was said i  cow cow coward hissed the pirate-colonel in my ear and gave me back the note  feeling that i must for ever tread the earth a branded boy person i mean or that i must clear up my honour i demanded to be tried by a court-martial the colonel admitted my right to be tried some difficulty was found in composing the court on account of the emperor of france's aunt refusing to let him come out he was to be the president 'ere yet we had appointed a substitute he made his escape over the back wall and stood among us a free monarch  [illustration  the court was held on the grass by the pond]  the court was held on the grass by the pond i recognised in a certain admiral among my judges my deadliest foe a cocoa-nut had given rise to language that i could not brook but confiding in my innocence and also in the knowledge that the president of the united states who sat next him owed me a knife i braced myself for the ordeal  [illustration  two executioners with pinafores reversed]  it was a solemn spectacle that court two executioners with pinafores reversed led me in under the shade of an umbrella i perceived my bride supported by the bride of the pirate-colonel the president having reproved a little female ensign for tittering on a matter of life or death called upon me to plead coward or no coward guilty or not guilty i pleaded in a firm tone no coward and not guilty the little female ensign being again reproved by the president for misconduct mutinied left the court and threw stones  my implacable enemy the admiral conducted the case against me the colonel's bride was called to prove that i had remained behind the corner-lamp-post during the engagement i might have been spared the anguish of my own bride's being also made a witness to the same point but the admiral knew where to wound me be still my soul no matter the colonel was then brought forward with his evidence  it was for this point that i had saved myself up as the turning-point of my case shaking myself free of my guards who had no business to hold me the stupids unless i was found guilty i asked the colonel what he considered the first duty of a soldier 'ere he could reply the president of the united states rose and informed the court that my foe the admiral had suggested bravery and that prompting a witness wasn't fair the president of the court immediately ordered the admiral's mouth to be filled with leaves and tied up with string i had the satisfaction of seeing the sentence carried into effect before the proceedings went further  i then took a paper from my trousers-pocket and asked  what do you consider colonel redforth the first duty of a soldier is it obedience  it is said the colonel  is that paper please to look at it in your hand  it is said the colonel  is it a military sketch  it is said the colonel  of an engagement  quite so said the colonel  of the late engagement  of the late engagement  please to describe it and then hand it to the president of the court  from that triumphant moment my sufferings and my dangers were at an end the court rose up and jumped on discovering that i had strictly obeyed orders my foe the admiral who though muzzled was malignant yet contrived to suggest that i was dishonoured by having quitted the field but the colonel himself had done as much and gave his opinion upon his word and honour as a pirate that when all was lost the field might be quitted without disgrace i was going to be found no coward and not guilty and my blooming bride was going to be publicly restored to my arms in a procession when an unlooked-for event disturbed the general rejoicing this was no other than the emperor of france's aunt catching hold of his hair the proceedings abruptly terminated and the court tumultuously dissolved  [illustration  the pirate-colonel with his bride and yesterday's gallant prisoner with his bride]  it was when the shades of the next evening but one were beginning to fall 'ere yet the silver beams of luna touched the earth that four forms might have been descried slowly advancing towards the weeping willow on the borders of the pond the now deserted scene of the day before yesterday's agonies and triumphs on a nearer approach and by a practised eye these might have been identified as the forms of the pirate-colonel with his bride and of the day before yesterday's gallant prisoner with his bride  on the beauteous faces of the nymphs dejection sat enthroned all four reclined under the willow for some minutes without speaking till at length the bride of the colonel poutingly observed it's of no use pretending any more and we had better give it up  hah exclaimed the pirate pretending  don't go on like that you worry me returned his bride  the lovely bride of tinkling echoed the incredible declaration the two warriors exchanged stoney glances  if said the bride of the pirate-colonel grown-up people won't do what they ought to do and will put us out what comes of our pretending  we only get into scrapes said the bride of tinkling  you know very well pursued the colonel's bride that miss drowvey wouldn't fall you complained of it yourself and you know how disgracefully the court-martial ended as to our marriage would my people acknowledge it at home  or would my people acknowledge ours said the bride of tinkling  again the two warriors exchanged stoney glances  if you knocked at the door and claimed me after you were told to go away said the colonel's bride you would only have your hair pulled or your ears or your nose  if you persisted in ringing at the bell and claiming me said the bride of tinkling to that gentleman you would have things dropped on your head from the window over the handle or you would be played upon by the garden-engine  and at your own homes resumed the bride of the colonel it would be just as bad you would be sent to bed or something equally undignified again  how would you support us  the pirate-colonel replied in a courageous voice by rapine but his bride retorted suppose the grown-up people wouldn't be rapined then said the colonel they should pay the penalty in blood but suppose they should object retorted his bride and wouldn't pay the penalty in blood or anything else  a mournful silence ensued  then do you no longer love me alice asked the colonel  redforth i am ever thine returned his bride  then do you no longer love me nettie asked the present writer  tinkling i am ever thine returned my bride  we all four embraced let me not be misunderstood by the giddy the colonel embraced his own bride and i embraced mine but two times two make four  nettie and i said alice mournfully have been considering our position the grown-up people are too strong for us they make us ridiculous besides they have changed the times william tinkling's baby-brother was christened yesterday what took place was any king present answer william  i said no unless disguised as great-uncle chopper  any queen  there had been no queen that i knew of at our house there might have been one in the kitchen but i didn't think so or the servants would have mentioned it  any fairies  none that were visible  we had an idea among us i think said alice with a melancholy smile we four that miss grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy and would come in at the christening with her crutch-stick and give the child a bad gift was there anything of that sort answer william  [illustration  we had an idea among us  that miss grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy]  i said that ma had said afterwards and so she had that great-uncle chopper's gift was a shabby one but she hadn't said a bad one she had called it shabby electrotyped second-hand and below his income  it must be the grown-up people who have changed all this said alice we couldn't have changed it if we had been so inclined and we never should have been or perhaps miss grimmer is a wicked fairy after all and won't act up to it because the grown-up people have persuaded her not to either way they would make us ridiculous if we told them what we expected  tyrants muttered the pirate-colonel  nay my redforth said alice say not so call not names my redforth or they will apply to pa  let 'em said the colonel i don't care who's he  tinkling here undertook the perilous task of remonstrating with his lawless friend who consented to withdraw the moody expressions above quoted  what remains for us to do alice went on in her mild wise way we must educate we must pretend in a new manner we must wait  the colonel clenched his teeth four out in front and a piece off another and he had been twice dragged to the door of a dentist-despot but had escaped from his guards how educate how pretend in a new manner how wait  educate the grown-up people replied alice we part to-night yes redforth for the colonel tucked up his cuffs part to-night let us in these next holidays now going to begin throw our thoughts into something educational for the grown-up people hinting to them how things ought to be let us veil our meaning under a mask of romance[a] you i and nettie william tinkling being the plainest and quickest writer shall copy out is it agreed  the colonel answered sulkily i don't mind he then asked how about pretending  we will pretend said alice that we are children not that we are those grown-up people who won't help us out as they ought and who understand us so badly  the colonel still much dissatisfied growled how about waiting  we will wait answered little alice taking nettie's hand in hers and looking up to the sky we will wait ever constant and true till the times have got so changed as that everything helps us out and nothing makes us ridiculous and the fairies have come back we will wait ever constant and true till we are eighty ninety or one hundred and then the fairies will send us children and we will help them out poor pretty little creatures if they pretend ever so much    so we will dear said nettie ashford taking her round the waist with both arms and kissing her and now if my husband will go and buy some cherries for us i have got some money  in the friendliest manner i invited the colonel to go with me but he so far forgot himself as to acknowledge the invitation by kicking out behind and then lying down on his stomach on the grass pulling it up and chewing it when i came back however alice had nearly brought him out of his vexation and was soothing him by telling him how soon we should all be ninety  as we sat under the willow-tree and ate the cherries fair for alice shared them out we played at being ninety nettie complained that she had a bone in her old back and it made her hobble and alice sang a song in an old woman's way but it was very pretty and we were all merry at least i don't know about merry exactly but all comfortable  there was a most tremendous lot of cherries and alice always had with her some neat little bag or box or case to hold things in it that night was a tiny wine-glass so alice and nettie said they would make some cherry-wine to drink our love at parting  [illustration  there was a most tremendous lot of cherries]  each of us had a glassful and it was delicious and each of us drank the toast our love at parting the colonel drank his wine last and it got into my head directly that it got into his directly anyhow his eyes rolled immediately after he had turned the glass upside down and he took me on one side and proposed in a hoarse whisper that we should cut 'em out still  how did he mean i asked my lawless friend  cut our brides out said the colonel and then cut our way without going down a single turning bang to the spanish main  we might have tried it though i didn't think it would answer only we looked round and saw that there was nothing but moonlight under the willow-tree and that our pretty pretty wives were gone we burst out crying the colonel gave in second and came to first but he gave in strong  we were ashamed of our red eyes and hung about for half an hour to whiten them likewise a piece of chalk round the rims i doing the colonel's and he mine but afterwards found in the bedroom looking-glass not natural besides inflammation our conversation turned on being ninety the colonel told me he had a pair of boots that wanted soleing and heeling but he thought it hardly worth while to mention it to his father as he himself should so soon be ninety when he thought shoes would be more convenient the colonel also told me with his hand upon his hip that he felt himself already getting on in life and turning rheumatic and i told him the same and when they said at our house at supper they are always bothering about something that i stooped i felt so

grass by the side of the wood   beneath a broad oak that for ages has stood   see the children of earth and the tenants of air   for an evening's amusement together repair  it was very early one delightful morning in summer when the trumpeter gadfly sounded his horn inviting all the insects in the forest to the butterfly's ball and the grasshopper's feast  the sun shone brightly the air was mild and soft and the scent of the wild flowers delicious so that not one of the insects thought of staying at home  butterflies beetles bees wasps snails grasshoppers ants all put on their best coats and frocks all put on their sweetest smiles and all hurried off in little bands to the ball talking and laughing and humming and buzzing by the way as if they were the happiest creatures in the wide world  even the old beetle that had been run over by a cart-wheel and squeezed nearly to death got out of bed when he heard what was going on and limped along with the rest though he had been confined to the house for six months before  one or two butterflies that were never known to go out except in the very finest weather and even then carefully wrapped up determined to venture  they were long in making up their minds about it  one thought it looked a very little like rain another feared that the light breeze might give them a cold  however they put on a great many cloaks and went  from all directions they came and assembled on a smooth grassy spot under an old oak-tree where the revels were to take place  some crawled slowly along the ground some bounded quickly over hill and dale some came running and tumbling jumping and hitting against things in their haste some came swiftly through the air and alighted so suddenly as to tumble head over heels others flew quietly to the scene and fluttered lightly about admiring the gay company they were about to join    and there came the beetle so blind and so black   who carried the emmet his friend on his back   and there came the gnat and the dragonfly too   and all their relations green orange and blue  the black beetle was the first to make his appearance  he carried his dear friend the emmet on his back and a sad journey they had of it to be sure  being very blind the beetle was constantly falling over twigs knocking his shins against the edges of leaves and tumbling into ditches so that the poor emmet had many terrible falls and once the great beetle fell on the top of him and crushed him a good deal  but it was very pleasant to see how cheerful they were under all this  on getting up after a fall the beetle always laughed so boisterously that the tears ran down his cheeks and his black sides nearly cracked while the little emmet said gaily ah my friend accidents will happen not hurt i hope  come get along once more and then he jumped up on his friend's back again and away they went as merrily as ever  a gnat and a dragonfly with a great many of their relations arrived about the same time with the beetle  they looked quite charming in their brilliant dresses the colours of which were chiefly green orange and blue  a large blue-bottle fly with a very light waistcoat and a hat stuck on one side of his head said that the dragonflies were lovely and that miss gnat was quite killing  this was an odd thing to say but mr blue-bottle meant by it that she was very beautiful indeed it was said that he fell in love with miss gnat for he danced with nobody else during the whole afternoon                                          and there came the moth with her plumage of down   and the hornet with jacket of yellow and brown   who with him the wasp his companion did bring    they promised that evening to lay by their sting  the moth was sound asleep when the gadfly blew his trumpet  she had sat up too late the night before and owing to having indulged this bad habit had overslept herself the following morning  however she tried by her activity to make up for lost time she saw the other insects hurrying past her house in crowds so she threw on her clothes as fast as possible  the moth was prettily dressed in a soft garment of down and as she was a modest creature every one loved her on leaving home she observed the wasp and the hornet passing  they were dressed in rich suits of brown and yellow  at sight of them she was a little frightened and endeavoured to run back to her house until they should pass by but they caught sight of her and immediately gave chase screaming out loudly oh dear mrs moth pray don't be alarmed we have laid by our stings for to-day and won't hurt you  they soon caught her although she ran as fast as she could  so the wasp and the hornet each offered her an arm and obliged her to walk between them while they danced along shouting and singing and winking waggishly to the friends they passed on the road  the poor moth blushed very much at being seen by all her friends in the company of two such wild creatures a caterpillar and a long-legged beetle besides one or two other insects that chanced to be near laughed very heartily on seeing what had happened  but the moth soon recovered her spirits and when they arrived at the oak-tree she was walking along with a sprightly step first talking to the hornet and then chatting to the wasp as if they were her dearest friends                                          then the sly little dormouse peeped out of his hole   and led to the feast his blind cousin the mole   and the snail with her horns peeping out from her shell   came fatigued with the distance the length of an ell  come along you lazy fellow cried the little dormouse knocking with his ivory-headed cane at the door of a mole-hill  ay ay cousin shouted the mole i'll be there in a minute  so the dormouse stood impatiently tapping his boots till the mole should be ready  the dormouse was dressed in the height of fashion and thought himself a rather handsome fellow  some people said that he was conceited and indeed a spider that was near at hand plainly told him so but whether this was true or not there is no doubt that he was a very kind little fellow because he came to lead his poor blind cousin to the feast  what a time you have been old boy he said as the mole appeared dusting the earth off his coat and white hat  the mole answered that he had been very busy all morning making a new tunnel between his bed-room and drawing-room  he then took his friend's arm and away they went over the green meadows where the cowslips and buttercups grew making the grass look as if it were dotted all over with gold  sometimes the two friends stopped by the way to rest under a buttercup and sip a little morning dew but seeing every one hastening past them while they wasted their time the dormouse jumped up again and cast a sly look at his blind friend as he asked him what he thought of the fine view  don't make jokes about my being blind said the mole pretending to be angry  just at that moment they both ran into a spider's web  oh how stupid of me cried the dormouse i wasn't looking before me at the time  you might as well be without eyes if you don't use them said the mole as they cleared away the threads of the net and making a low bow to the spider went on their way  now all this time the snail had been slowly creeping over the stones and winding round the blades of grass and flowers that strewed her path to the place of meeting  but she was so long of getting there that the guests began to be impatient and said that perhaps she was not coming at all  she lived under the next tree and had only about four feet to walk but she was so very slow that she took a long long time to it and at last the grasshopper whispered to the butterfly that she should go and meet her  away went the butterfly on her gaudy wings and alighting by the snail's side began to urge her to make haste  during the butterfly's absence the wasp who was always making spiteful remarks said that it was shameful in the snail to keep them waiting but the humble-bee who was walking up and down conversing with a midge turned round and said remember you wasp that you have not brought your sting with you to-day so pray do not give way to your spiteful nature  the poor snail has to carry her house on her back so we should not be angry at her slowness  some of the other insects said that this was no excuse for the snail because she knew that she walked very slowly and should therefore have set out sooner  come come cried a young frog jumping forward no fighting to-day ladies and gentlemen  we have come here to be happy and here comes the snail at last  as he spoke the butterfly flew towards them and the snail crawled in took off her bonnet put on her spectacles and sat down while the waiters bustled about placed stools for the guests and brought in the repast a mushroom the table and on it was spread   a water-dock leaf which their table-cloth made   the viands were various to each of their taste   and the bee brought the honey to sweeten the feast  it was perhaps the strangest dinner-party that ever was seen  there were such a multitude of odd creatures of all shapes and sizes and colours some of whom were by nature bitter enemies and would have fought and killed each other had they met in the woods while taking a walk but were quite civil and polite to one another now that they met as guests in mrs butterfly's bower  indeed many of them wished that they could be such good friends at all times as they were then  all the party had now arrived and there was a great deal of talking and buzzing and humming and jesting as they sat round the table and feasted on the good things placed before them  the table was a mushroom covered with a table-cloth of water-dock leaf and on it were placed all the delicious dishes of the woods  the dormouse brought a good deal of wheat oats and barley  the squirrel brought a bagful of nuts  the humble-bee brought a quantity of fine honey in the comb which was declared to be most excellent  in short every one brought something or other so that when all was spread out beside the good things supplied by mrs butterfly and mr grasshopper it seemed the grandest feast that ever was heard of  such fun there was to be sure and such a multitude of voices talking all at once  my dear cried the butterfly across the table to the grasshopper i hope you are attending to your friends there  see that you give them enough to eat and plenty of mountain-dew to drink  yes yes my love replied the grasshopper as well as he could for laughing at the jokes of a bloated old spider that sat beside him  then the grasshopper called to the butterfly to send him a slice of wheat but as the noise prevented his being heard he jumped over the table at one bound helped himself and bounded back again  two or three young crickets and five or six midges sat at a little side mushroom  they made more noise than all the grownup people put together and the lady butterfly looked round at them with a smile once or twice quite delighted to see them so happy and to hear their merry voices ringing through the woods                                          with steps more majestic the snail did advance   and he promised the gazers a minuet dance   but they all laughed so loudly he pulled in his head   and went in his own little chamber to bed  after dinner the ball began and it was the strangest ball that ever was seen  the trumpeter gadfly and a number of his relations besides several grasshoppers and bees were the chief musicians  they wanted a bass very much at first but the bull-frog offered his services although he confessed that he was accustomed to sing alone  then the gentlemen drew on their gloves flattened their wings pulled up their collars and coiled away their tails while the ladies tightened their garters ruffled their feathers and put out their feelers  oh how they did dance reels were nothing to it  the greatest difficulty was to keep the grasshoppers in order  they became so excited that they sprang quite out of sight every moment and so lost their partners and ran against everybody in searching for them  then the bull-frog who sang bass got a little too much of the dew and sang so loudly that he quite drowned all the other players  so mrs butterfly put her claws in her ears and running up to him said oh dear mr bull-frog pray do not sing quite so loudly  the poor bull-frog was almost weeping with joy at the merry scene before him but he blushed very green on hearing this and said he had forgotten what he was doing but would try to be more careful  however in five minutes more he was worse than ever so they sent a few hundred bees to sing treble beside him and try to keep him in order  in the middle of all this there was a sudden stop and a snail stepping forward offered to dance a minuet  this was received with such a roar of laughter that the poor snail half frightened half angry drew in his horns and went to bed on the spot and the dance was begun anew  by this time the gnats and midges and some of the other flies had left the ground and retired to enjoy a cool dance in the air two or three spiders mounted up into the oak and fastened threads to some of the branches by which they dropped suddenly down among the dancers and seizing their partners round the waist carried them screaming in among the leaves  so the fun and the noise became louder and louder  on the ground under the bushes among the branches of the trees and in the air the dancers bounded skipped laughed sang shouted and flew in a way that had never been seen or heard of before the merry old bull-frog became quite absurd  he sang and roared like a lion took up all the young insects in his arms and hugged them tumbled over the other musicians and in short did so many wild things that they were at length obliged to tie him to a paddock-stool where they left him to enjoy himself then as evening gave way to the shadows of night   their watchman the glow-worm came out with his light   so home let us hasten while yet we can see   for no watchman is waiting for you or for me  the sun went down at last but still the dancers continued their sport under the old oak-tree when suddenly a clear beautiful light streamed across the turf  it was the glow-worm's light  how charming exclaimed the butterfly  it is such a sweet subdued light  rather too much subdued growled the blundering black beetle as he tripped over a twig and pulled his partner a humble-bee down with him couldn't you shine a little brighter eh  the glow-worm shook his head  couldn't give you another ray to save my life he said but if you send for a few of my friends they will be happy to come and help me no doubt  a good suggestion said the black beetle assisting his partner to rise  oh my poor frock cried the humble-bee gazing sadly at a long rent in the skirt  never mind let's have at it again cried the beetle seizing her round the waist and blundering on again in a furious gallop of his own invention  whom shall i send for the glow-worm's relations muttered the butterfly to herself  send the snail said a lively young cricket who had devoted himself to doing mischief during the whole evening  peace little goose replied the butterfly tapping the cricket on the nose with her fan and hastening towards the grasshopper who was still enthralled and convulsed by the bloated old spider  whom should we send my dear said the grasshopper in reply to the butterfly's question the fly footman to be sure and pray tell him to be smart about it for i've been run down half-a-dozen times already by the dancers since the sun set  one lamp is too little for our ball-room  that blind mole has run ha there he comes again  look out  as he spoke the mole came bearing down towards them in a furious portuguese waltz with a horrified dragonfly struggling in his arms  the grasshopper made a bound to get out of the way but at that moment the lively young cricket laid hold of his leg and held him fast  the consequence was that the mole tumbled over him fell on the top of the bloated spider and hit his head so violently on the breast of the bull-frog that he stopped his noise immediately  this sudden stoppage of the bass brought the other musicians to a stand and as a matter of course stopped the dancing abruptly with the exception of a deaf squirrel who had failed to find a partner and who went on revolving slowly by himself as if nothing had happened  dear me exclaimed everybody except the squirrel what has happened  oh nothing worth mentioning said the grasshopper getting up with a limp  you young rascal what why there take that  oh sobbed the young cricket pointing with a look of surprise at the spider what a sight  he might well say so for the bloated old spider had been flattened out by the weight of the mole to nearly twice her size and was apparently quite dead  in great concern the host and hostess ran to raise her  are you hurt dear asked the butterfly anxiously  hurt exclaimed the grasshopper pushing her aside don't you see she's burst  oh me  i'm so sorry exclaimed the mole wringing his fore-paws  at that moment there was a shout of eager expectation for the spider was seen to move  the butterfly knelt at her side and bending down said tenderly   tell me dear has he burst you  n-no n-not qu-quite answered the spider faintly i'm only f-flattened  let some of you sq-squeeze m-my sides  immediately a dozen of the young crickets surrounded the old lady and pressed her sides with all their might  this had the effect of raising her back a little and enabling her to draw a good long breath which speedily raised her up to her original size  there i'm all right now she said in a cheerful voice i'm used to accidents of that sort and they never leave any bad effects beyond a little stiffness of the lungs  come grasshopper i'll finish that story  get on with your dancing good people  nobody inquires after me croaked the bull-frog rubbing his chest i had no idea a mole's head was so hard  have some mountain-dew said the butterfly gracefully handing him a blue-bell filled with the precious liquid  it has been gathered on the scottish hills by a native bee who has just arrived laden with heather-honey  the bull-frog accepted the goblet and drained it to the bottom  it is strong he said coughing and smacking his lips  oo ay observed the scotch bee it's got the credit o' bein' a wee thing nippy  under the influence of the dew the bull-frog began to sing bass lustily the other musicians chimed in  the dancers seized each other by waist and hand or by tail and wing those that happened to have no waists or hands and the ball was about to go on when the grasshopper shouted   stop  your money or your life added the lively young cricket  silence pert monkey let us wait a few moments my friends for here come our lamps  as she spoke a soft light was seen in the far distance gleaming upon the stems of the trees and steadily advancing  your relations mr glow-worm i presume said the butterfly in a sweet silvery voice  it is so very kind of you to send for them and so obliging in them to come  really i cannot find words to express my gratitude  the countenance of the glow-worm lighted up with pleasure at these words  as the new-comers drew near they appeared like a great galaxy of minute stars as if a mass of the milky-way had been cut off and hurled down to earth  there were several hundreds of them  as they approached the whole forest lighted up and when at last they descended upon the scene of the ball and ranged themselves in a circle round the gay party it seemed as if the sun himself had risen again to give them light only the radiance was softer and more mysteriously tender than that of the sun  strong light has always an enlivening effect on creatures whether human or otherwise  it cheered up the guests of mrs butterfly so much that they gave vent to an irresistible cheer called for the music and went on to dancing with more zest and energy than ever insomuch that the attendant glow-worms smiled to each other and nodded their heads  now it happened that every time the glow-worms smiled their light increased  the lively young cricket observed this and began to wonder whether their light would increase still more if they were to laugh  i'll try to find out said he going up to a small glow-worm  apparently a young one and requesting her to step aside with him for a moment  the little glow-worm immediately became grave in other words dim and went with him a little way into the woods  now said the lively young cricket stopping can you laugh  what said the little glow-worm smiling and of course lighting up  yes that's it smile away but do it harder  i want you to laugh outright  can't you laugh  oh yes when there is anything to laugh at  well do it now  but i can't please  no then i'll make you  so saying the young cricket seized the little glow-worm round the waist and tickled her  of course she laughed at first and to the cricket's delight her face became wonderfully bright for a moment but suddenly it became dim for he hurt her and she began to cry  you rascal exclaimed an angry voice as the grasshopper gave the cricket a kick that sent him head over heels into the grass i felt sure you were after mischief and i was right  oh please don't kick him pleaded the little glow-worm  he didn't mean to hurt me  no matter  get up sir and beg her pardon  the young cricket got up at once and did what he was bid for he really did not mean mischief and was sorry he had hurt her and little miss glow-worm rewarded him with a smile so radiant that it illuminated the spot where they stood quite brilliantly and sparkled through her tears with rainbow hues  now i would laugh to please you if i could said miss glow-worm again smiling  oh never mind my dear  i'll make you and all your kindred laugh before the ball is over said the lively young cricket hurrying away and going straight up to the scotch bee who was clad in a tartan plaid and kilt  bee said the cricket can you dance the highland fling  ay she can do that  i could show you a better fling than the highland one said the cricket  ho could ye ye must be verra cliver  wull ye let her see't  yes if you'll dance the highland fling first  will you do it if mrs butterfly asks you  the scotch bee good-naturedly agreed  of course the cricket had no difficulty in persuading the hostess to ask him  the musicians could not play a reel but this mattered not for the bee could hum to himself  great was the delight and surprise of the company when they beheld the scotch bee twirling his legs snapping his fingers and humming the reel of tulloch while the tartans fluttered round him like shreds of a shattered rainbow  the dance waxed more and more furious and the plaudits of the company grew louder when suddenly the lively young cricket ran in between the bee's legs tripped him up and sent him sprawling on the grass  a wild shout of laughter burst from the company glow-worms included and the ball-room brightened up for a few moments as if it had been set on fire  that's the fling i spoke of cried the cricket leaping up and running away  the scotch bee sprang up drew his dirk and gave chase but mr grasshopper caught him by the arm and dragged him off  ho friends supper supper  this way  don't sheathe your dirk  i have a haggis ready for you to sheathe it in  come along give your arm to that bloated old spider there  she'll keep you in spirits  the bee was mollified  he gave his arm to the spider then all the company went off to sup in a neighbouring glade  shall we describe the supper  we think not  it was beyond description delightful  just as it was finished the moon rose from behind a cloud so the company knew that it was time to go home  before going away they all assembled at the foot of the oak and shook claws with lady butterfly and mr grasshopper saying that they were charmed with the delightful evening they had spent and that they hoped to be soon invited again  in a few minutes they were all gone  the sounds of their laughing voices as they returned home died gradually away and the shadows of night spread over the quiet forest and the happy little creatures that slumbered there"@"ThePeacock'At
