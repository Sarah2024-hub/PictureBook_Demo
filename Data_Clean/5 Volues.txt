"[illustration  several of the children were growing out of their clothes]  there was once a king and he had a queen and he was the manliest of his sex and she was the loveliest of hers the king was in his private profession under government the queen's father had been a medical man out of town  they had nineteen children and were always having more seventeen of these children took care of the baby and alicia the eldest took care of them all their ages varied from seven years to seven months  let us now resume our story  one day the king was going to the office when he stopped at the fishmonger's to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail which the queen who was a careful housekeeper had requested him to send home mr pickles the fishmonger said certainly sir is there any other article good-morning  the king went on towards the office in a melancholy mood for quarter day was such a long way off and several of the dear children were growing out of their clothes he had not proceeded far when mr pickles's errand-boy came running after him and said sir you didn't notice the old lady in our shop  what old lady enquired the king i saw none  now the king had not seen any old lady because this old lady had been invisible to him though visible to mr pickles's boy probably because he messed and splashed the water about to that degree and flopped the pairs of soles down in that violent manner that if she had not been visible to him he would have spoilt her clothes  just then the old lady came trotting up she was dressed in shot-silk of the richest quality smelling of dried lavender  king watkins the first i believe said the old lady  watkins replied the king is my name  papa if i am not mistaken of the beautiful princess alicia said the old lady  and of eighteen other darlings replied the king  listen you are going to the office said the old lady  it instantly flashed upon the king that she must be a fairy or how could she know that  you are right said the old lady answering his thoughts i am the good fairy grandmarina attend when you return home to dinner politely invite the princess alicia to have some of the salmon you bought just now  it may disagree with her said the king  the old lady became so very angry at this absurd idea that the king was quite alarmed and humbly begged her pardon  we hear a great deal too much about this thing disagreeing and that thing disagreeing said the old lady with the greatest contempt it was possible to express don't be greedy i think you want it all yourself  the king hung his head under this reproof and said he wouldn't talk about things disagreeing any more  be good then said the fairy grandmarina and don't when the beautiful princess alicia consents to partake of the salmon as i think she will you will find she will leave a fish-bone on her plate tell her to dry it and to rub it and to polish it till it shines like mother-of-pearl and to take care of it as a present from me  is that all asked the king  don't be impatient sir returned the fairy grandmarina scolding him severely don't catch people short before they have done speaking just the way with you grown-up persons you are always doing it  the king again hung his head and said he wouldn't do so any more  be good then said the fairy grandmarina and don't tell the princess alicia with my love that the fish-bone is a magic present which can only be used once but that it will bring her that once whatever she wishes for provided she wishes for it at the right time that is the message take care of it  [illustration  hoity toity me]  the king was beginning might i ask the reason  when the fairy became absolutely furious  will you be good sir she exclaimed stamping her foot on the ground the reason for this and the reason for that indeed you are always wanting the reason no reason there hoity toity me i am sick of your grown-up reasons  the king was extremely frightened by the old lady's flying into such a passion and said he was very sorry to have offended her and he wouldn't ask for reasons any more  be good then said the old lady and don't  with those words grandmarina vanished and the king went on and on and on till he came to the office there he wrote and wrote and wrote till it was time to go home again then he politely invited the princess alicia as the fairy had directed him to partake of the salmon and when she had enjoyed it very much he saw the fish-bone on her plate as the fairy had told him he would and he delivered the fairy's message and the princess alicia took care to dry the bone and to rub it and to polish it till it shone like mother-of-pearl  [illustration  he saw the fish-bone on her plate]  and so when the queen was going to get up in the morning she said o dear me dear me my head my head and then she fainted away  the princess alicia who happened to be looking in at the chamber-door asking about breakfast was very much alarmed when she saw her royal mamma in this state and she rang the bell for peggy which was the name of the lord chamberlain but remembering where the smelling-bottle was she climbed on a chair and got it and after that she climbed on another chair by the bedside and held the smelling-bottle to the queen's nose and after that she jumped down and got some water and after that she jumped up again and wetted the queen's forehead and in short when the lord chamberlain came in that dear old woman said to the little princess what a trot you are i couldn't have done it better myself    but that was not the worst of the good queen's illness o no she was very ill indeed for a long time the princess alicia kept the seventeen young princes and princesses quiet and dressed and undressed and danced the baby and made the kettle boil and heated the soup and swept the hearth and poured out the medicine and nursed the queen and did all that ever she could and was as busy busy busy as busy could be for there were not many servants at that palace for three reasons because the king was short of money because a rise in his office never seemed to come and because quarter day was so far off that it looked almost as far off and as little as one of the stars  but on the morning when the queen fainted away where was the magic fish-bone why there it was in the princess alicia's pocket she had almost taken it out to bring the queen to life again when she put it back and looked for the smelling-bottle  after the queen had come out of her swoon that morning and was dozing the princess alicia hurried up-stairs to tell a most particular secret to a most particularly confidential friend of hers who was a duchess people did suppose her to be a doll but she was really a duchess though nobody knew it except the princess    this most particular secret was a secret about the magic fish-bone the history of which was well known to the duchess because the princess told her everything the princess kneeled down by the bed on which the duchess was lying full-dressed and wide awake and whispered the secret to her the duchess smiled and nodded people might have supposed that she never smiled and nodded but she often did though nobody knew it except the princess  then the princess alicia hurried downstairs again to keep watch in the queen's room she often kept watch by herself in the queen's room but every evening while the illness lasted she sat there watching with the king and every evening the king sat looking at her with a cross look wondering why she never brought out the magic fish-bone as often as she noticed this she ran up-stairs whispered the secret to the duchess over again and said to the duchess besides they think we children never have a reason or a meaning and the duchess though the most fashionable duchess that ever was heard of winked her eye  alicia said the king one evening when she wished him good night  yes papa  what is become of the magic fish-bone  in my pocket papa  i thought you had lost it  o no papa  or forgotten it  no indeed papa  and so another time the dreadful little snapping pug-dog next door made a rush at one of the young princes as he stood on the steps coming home from school and terrified him out of his wits and he put his hand through a pane of glass and bled bled bled when the seventeen other young princes and princesses saw him bleed bleed bleed they were terrified out of their wits too and screamed themselves black in their seventeen faces all at once but the princess alicia put her hands over all their seventeen mouths one after another and persuaded them to be quiet because of the sick queen and then she put the wounded prince's hand in a basin of fresh cold water while they stared with their twice seventeen are thirty-four put down four and carry three eyes and then she looked in the hand for bits of glass and there were fortunately no bits of glass there and then she said to two chubby-legged princes who were sturdy though small bring me in the royal rag-bag i must snip and stitch and cut and contrive so those two young princes tugged at the royal rag-bag and lugged it in and the princess alicia sat down on the floor with a large pair of scissors and a needle and thread and snipped and stitched and cut and contrived and made a bandage and put it on and it fitted beautifully and so when it was all done she saw the king her papa looking on by the door    alicia  yes papa  what have you been doing  snipping stitching cutting and contriving papa  where is the magic fish-bone  in my pocket papa  i thought you had lost it  o no papa  or forgotten it  no indeed papa  after that she ran up-stairs to the duchess and told her what had passed and told her the secret over again and the duchess shook her flaxen curls and laughed with her rosy lips    well and so another time the baby fell under the grate the seventeen young princes and princesses were used to it for they were almost always falling under the grate or down the stairs but the baby was not used to it yet and it gave him a swelled face and a black eye the way the poor little darling came to tumble was that he slid out of the princess alicia's lap just as she was sitting in a great coarse apron that quite smothered her in front of the kitchen-fire beginning to peel the turnips for the broth for dinner and the way she came to be doing that was that the king's cook had run away that morning with her own true love who was a very tall but very tipsy soldier then the seventeen young princes and princesses who cried at everything that happened cried and roared but the princess alicia who couldn't help crying a little herself quietly called to them to be still on account of not throwing back the queen up-stairs who was fast getting well and said hold your tongues you wicked little monkeys every one of you while i examine baby then she examined baby and found that he hadn't broken anything and she held cold iron to his poor dear eye and smoothed his poor dear face and he presently fell asleep in her arms then she said to the seventeen princes and princesses i am afraid to lay him down yet lest he should wake and feel pain be good and you shall all be cooks they jumped for joy when they heard that and began making themselves cooks' caps out of old newspapers so to one she gave the salt-box and to one she gave the barley and to one she gave the herbs and to one she gave the turnips and to one she gave the carrots and to one she gave the onions and to one she gave the spice-box till they were all cooks and all running about at work she sitting in the middle smothered in the great coarse apron nursing baby by and by the broth was done and the baby woke up smiling like an angel and was trusted to the sedatest princess to hold while the other princes and princesses were squeezed into a far-off corner to look at the princess alicia turning out the saucepan-full of broth for fear as they were always getting into trouble they should get splashed and scalded when the broth came tumbling out steaming beautifully and smelling like a nosegay good to eat they clapped their hands that made the baby clap his hands and that and his looking as if he had a comic toothache made all the princes and princesses laugh so the princess alicia said laugh and be good and after dinner we will make him a nest on the floor in a corner and he shall sit in his nest and see a dance of eighteen cooks that delighted the young princes and princesses and they ate up all the broth and washed up all the plates and dishes and cleared away and pushed the table into a corner and then they in their cooks' caps and the princess alicia in the smothering coarse apron that belonged to the cook that had run away with her own true love that was the very tall but very tipsy soldier danced a dance of eighteen cooks before the angelic baby who forgot his swelled face and his black eye and crowed with joy  [illustration  the dance of the eighteen cooks]  and so then once more the princess alicia saw king watkins the first her father standing in the doorway looking on and he said  what have you been doing alicia  cooking and contriving papa  what else have you been doing alicia  keeping the children light-hearted papa  where is the magic fish-bone alicia  in my pocket papa  i thought you had lost it  o no papa  or forgotten it  no indeed papa  the king then sighed so heavily and seemed so low-spirited and sat down so miserably leaning his head upon his hand and his elbow upon the kitchen table pushed away in the corner that the seventeen princes and princesses crept softly out of the kitchen and left him alone with the princess alicia and the angelic baby  what is the matter papa  i am dreadfully poor my child  have you no money at all papa  [illustration  what is the matter papa]  none my child  is there no way left of getting any papa  no way said the king i have tried very hard and i have tried all ways  when she heard those last words the princess alicia began to put her hand into the pocket where she kept the magic fish-bone  papa said she when we have tried very hard and tried all ways we must have done our very very best  no doubt alicia  when we have done our very very best papa and that is not enough then i think the right time must have come for asking help of others this was the very secret connected with the magic fish-bone which she had found out for herself from the good fairy grandmarina's words and which she had so often whispered to her beautiful and fashionable friend the duchess  so she took out of her pocket the magic fish-bone that had been dried and rubbed and polished till it shone like mother-of-pearl and she gave it one little kiss and wished it was quarter day and immediately it was quarter day and the king's quarter's salary came rattling down the chimney and bounced into the middle of the floor  but this was not half of what happened no not a quarter for immediately afterwards the good fairy grandmarina came riding in in a carriage and four peacocks with mr pickles's boy up behind dressed in silver and gold with a cocked hat powdered hair pink silk stockings a jewelled cane and a nosegay down jumped mr pickles's boy with his cocked hat in his hand and wonderfully polite being entirely changed by enchantment and handed grandmarina out and there she stood in her rich shot silk smelling of dried lavender fanning herself with a sparkling fan  alicia my dear said this charming old fairy how do you do i hope i see you pretty well give me a kiss  the princess alicia embraced her and then grandmarina turned to the king and said rather sharply  are you good  [illustration  alicia my dear  how do you do]  the king said he hoped so  i suppose you know the reason now why my god-daughter here kissing the princess again did not apply to the fish-bone sooner said the fairy  the king made her a shy bow  ah but you didn't then said the fairy  the king made her a shyer bow  any more reasons to ask for said the fairy  the king said no and he was very sorry  be good then said the fairy and live happy ever afterwards  then grandmarina waved her fan and the queen came in most splendidly dressed and the seventeen young princes and princesses no longer grown out of their clothes came in newly fitted out from top to toe with tucks in everything to admit of its being let out after that the fairy tapped the princess alicia with her fan and the smothering coarse apron flew away and she appeared exquisitely dressed like a little bride with a wreath of orange-flowers and a silver veil after that the kitchen dresser changed of itself into a wardrobe made of beautiful woods and gold and looking glass which was full of dresses of all sorts all for her and all exactly fitting her after that the angelic baby came in running alone with his face and eye not a bit the worse but much the better then grandmarina begged to be introduced to the duchess and when the duchess was brought down many compliments passed between them  a little whispering took place between the fairy and the duchess and then the fairy said out loud yes i thought she would have told you grandmarina then turned to the king and queen and said we are going in search of prince certainpersonio the pleasure of your company is requested at church in half an hour precisely so she and the princess alicia got into the carriage and mr pickles's boy handed in the duchess who sat by herself on the opposite seat and then mr pickles's boy put up the steps and got up behind and the peacocks flew away with their tails spread  [illustration  she appeared exquisitely dressed like a little bride]  prince certainpersonio was sitting by himself eating barley-sugar and waiting to be ninety when he saw the peacocks followed by the carriage coming in at the window it immediately occurred to him that something uncommon was going to happen  prince said grandmarina i bring you your bride  the moment the fairy said those words prince certainpersonio's face left off being stickey and his jacket and corduroys changed to peach-bloom velvet and his hair curled and a cap and feather flew in like a bird and settled on his head he got into the carriage by the fairy's invitation and there he renewed his acquaintance with the duchess whom he had seen before  in the church were the prince's relations and friends and the princess alicia's relations and friends and the seventeen princes and princesses and the baby and a crowd of the neighbours the marriage was beautiful beyond expression the duchess was bridesmaid and beheld the ceremony from the pulpit where she was supported by the cushion of the desk  grandmarina gave a magnificent wedding feast afterwards in which there was everything and more to eat and everything and more to drink the wedding cake was delicately ornamented with white satin ribbons frosted silver and white lilies and was forty-two yards round  when grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple and prince certainpersonio had made a speech and everybody had cried hip hip hip hurrah grandmarina announced to the king and queen that in future there would be eight quarter days in every year except in leap year when there would be ten she then turned to certainpersonio and alicia and said my dears you will have thirty-five children and they will all be good and beautiful seventeen of your children will be boys and eighteen will be girls the hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally they will never have the measles and will have recovered from the whooping-cough before being born  on hearing such good news everybody cried out hip hip hip hurrah again  it only remains said grandmarina in conclusion to make an end of the fish-bone  so she took it from the hand of the princess alicia and it instantly flew down the throat of the dreadful little snapping pug-dog next door and choked him and he expired in convulsions"@"TheMagicFishbone"@"CharlesDickens"
"the subject of our present narrative would appear to have devoted himself to the pirate profession at a comparatively early age we find him in command of a splendid schooner of one hundred guns loaded to the muzzle 'ere yet he had had a party in honour of his tenth birthday  it seems that our hero considering himself spited by a latin-grammar-master demanded the satisfaction due from one man of honour to another not getting it he privately withdrew his haughty spirit from such low company bought a second-hand pocket-pistol folded up some sandwiches in a paper bag made a bottle of spanish liquorice-water and entered on a career of valour  it were tedious to follow boldheart for such was his name through the commencing stages of his history suffice it that we find him bearing the rank of captain boldheart reclining in full uniform on a crimson hearth-rug spread out upon the quarter-deck of his schooner the beauty in the china seas it was a lovely evening and as his crew lay grouped about him he favoured them with the following melody        o landsmen are folly      o pirates are jolly      o diddleum dolly                       di          chorus heave yo  the soothing effect of these animated sounds floating over the waters as the common sailors united their rough voices to take up the rich tones of boldheart may be more easily conceived than described  it was under these circumstances that the lookout at the masthead gave the word whales  all was now activity  where away cried captain boldheart starting up  on the larboard bow sir replied the fellow at the masthead touching his hat for such was the height of discipline on board of the beauty that even at that height he was obliged to mind it or be shot through the head  [illustration  his crew lay grouped around him]  this adventure belongs to me said boldheart boy my harpoon let no man follow and leaping alone into his boat the captain rowed with admirable dexterity in the direction of the monster  all was now excitement  he nears him said an elderly seaman following the captain through his spy-glass  he strikes him said another seaman a mere stripling but also with a spy-glass  he tows him towards us said another seaman a man in the full vigour of life but also with a spy-glass  in fact the captain was seen approaching with the huge bulk following we will not dwell on the deafening cries of boldheart boldheart with which he was received when carelessly leaping on the quarter-deck he presented his prize to his men they afterwards made two thousand four hundred and seventeen pound ten and sixpence by it  ordering the sails to be braced up the captain now stood wnw the beauty flew rather than floated over the dark blue waters nothing particular occurred for a fortnight except taking with considerable slaughter four spanish galleons and a snow from south america all richly laden inaction began to tell upon the spirits of the men captain boldheart called all hands aft and said   my lads i hear there are discontented ones among ye let any such stand forth  after some murmuring in which the expressions aye aye sir union jack avast starboard port bowsprit and similar indications of a mutinous undercurrent though subdued were audible bill boozey captain of the foretop came out from the rest his form was that of a giant but he quailed under the captain's eye  what are your wrongs said the captain  why d'ye see captain boldheart replied the towering mariner i've sailed man and boy for many a year but i never yet know'd the milk served out for the ship's company's teas to be so sour as 'tis aboard this craft  [illustration  the rescue of william boozey]  at this moment the thrilling cry man overboard announced to the astonished crew that boozey in stepping back as the captain in mere thoughtfulness laid his hand upon the faithful pocket-pistol which he wore in his belt had lost his balance and was struggling with the foaming tide  all was now stupefaction  but with captain boldheart to throw off his uniform coat regardless of the various rich orders with which it was decorated and to plunge into the sea after the drowning giant was the work of a moment maddening was the excitement when boats were lowered intense the joy when the captain was seen holding up the drowning man with his teeth deafening the cheering when both were restored to the main deck of the beauty and from the instant of his changing his wet clothes for dry ones captain boldheart had no such devoted though humble friend as william boozey  boldheart now pointed to the horizon and called the attention of his crew to the taper spars of a ship lying snug in harbour under the guns of a fort  she shall be ours at sunrise said he serve out a double allowance of grog and prepare for action  all was now preparation  when morning dawned after a sleepless night it was seen that the stranger was crowding on all sail to come out of the harbour and offer battle as the two ships came nearer to each other the stranger fired a gun and hoisted roman colours boldheart then perceived her to be the latin-grammar-master's bark such indeed she was and had been tacking about the world in unavailing pursuit from the time of his first taking to a roving life  boldheart now addressed his men promising to blow them up if he should feel convinced that their reputation required it and giving orders that the latin-grammar-master should be taken alive he then dismissed them to their quarters and the fight began with a broadside from the beauty she then veered round and poured in another the scorpion so was the bark of the latin-grammar-master appropriately called was not slow to return her fire and a terrific cannonading ensued in which the guns of the beauty did tremendous execution  the latin-grammar-master was seen upon the poop in the midst of the smoke and fire encouraging his men to do him justice he was no craven though his white hat his short grey trousers and his long snuff-coloured surtout reaching to his heels the self-same coat in which he had spited boldheart contrasted most unfavourably with the brilliant uniform of the latter at this moment boldheart seizing a pike and putting himself at the head of his men gave the word to board  a desperate conflict ensued in the hammock nettings or somewhere in about that direction until the latin-grammar-master having all his masts gone his hull and rigging shot through and through and seeing boldheart slashing a path towards him hauled down his flag himself gave up his sword to boldheart and asked for quarter scarce had he been put into the captain's boat 'ere the scorpion went down with all on board  on captain boldheart's now assembling his men a circumstance occurred he found it necessary with one blow of his cutlass to kill the cook who having lost his brother in the late action was making at the latin-grammar-master in an infuriated state intent on his destruction with a carving-knife  captain boldheart then turned to the latin-grammar-master severely reproaching him with his perfidy and put it to his crew what they considered that a master who spited a boy deserved  they answered with one voice death  it may be so said the captain but it shall never be said that boldheart stained his hour of triumph with the blood of his enemy prepare the cutter  the cutter was immediately prepared  without taking your life said the captain i must yet for ever deprive you of the power of spiting other boys i shall turn you adrift in this boat you will find in her two oars a compass a bottle of rum a small cask of water a piece of pork a bag of biscuit and my latin grammar go and spite the natives if you can find any  deeply conscious of this bitter sarcasm the unhappy wretch was put into the cutter and was soon left far behind he made no effort to row but was seen lying on his back with his legs up when last made out by the ship's telescopes  a stiff breeze now beginning to blow captain boldheart gave orders to keep her ssw easing her a little during the night by falling off a point or two w by w or even by ws if she complained much he then retired for the night having in truth much need of repose in addition to the fatigues he had undergone this brave officer had received sixteen wounds in the engagement but had not mentioned it  in the morning a white squall came on and was succeeded by other squalls of various colours it thundered and lightened heavily for six weeks hurricanes then set in for two months waterspouts and tornadoes followed the oldest sailor on board and he was a very old one had never seen such weather the beauty lost all idea where she was and the carpenter reported six feet two of water in the hold everybody fell senseless at the pumps every day  provisions now ran very low our hero put the crew on short allowance and put himself on shorter allowance than any man in the ship but his spirit kept him fat in this extremity the gratitude of boozey the captain of the foretop whom our readers may remember was truly affecting the loving though lowly william repeatedly requested to be killed and preserved for the captain's table  we now approach a change in affairs  one day during a gleam of sunshine and when the weather had moderated the man at the masthead too weak now to touch his hat besides its having been blown away called out  savages  all was now expectation  presently fifteen hundred canoes each paddled by twenty savages were seen advancing in excellent order they were a light green colour the savages were and sang with great energy the following strain     choo a choo a choo tooth     muntch muntch nycey   choo a choo a choo tooth     muntch muntch nyce  as the shades of night were by this time closing in these expressions were supposed to embody this simple people's views of the evening hymn but it too soon appeared that the song was a translation of for what we are going to receive &c  the chief imposingly decorated with feathers of lively colours and having the majestic appearance of a fighting parrot no sooner understood he understood english perfectly that the ship was the beauty captain boldheart than he fell upon his face on the deck and could not be persuaded to rise until the captain had lifted him up & told him he wouldn't hurt him all the rest of the savages also fell on their faces with marks of terror and had also to be lifted up one by one thus the fame of the great boldheart had gone before him even among these children of nature  turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing numbers and on these and yams the people made a hearty meal after dinner the chief told captain boldheart that there was better feeding up at the village and that he would be glad to take him and his officers there apprehensive of treachery boldheart ordered his boat's crew to attend him completely armed and well were it for other commanders if their precautions but let us not anticipate  [illustration  arm-in-arm with the chief]  [illustration  two savages floured him before putting him to the fire]  when the canoes arrived at the beach the darkness of the night was illumined by the light of an immense fire ordering his boat's crew with the intrepid though illiterate william at their head to keep close and be upon their guard boldheart bravely went on arm-in-arm with the chief  but how to depict the captain's surprise when he found a ring of savages singing in chorus that barbarous translation of for what we are going to receive &c which has been given above and dancing hand-in-hand round the latin-grammar-master in a hamper with his head shaved while two savages floured him before putting him to the fire to be cooked  boldheart now took counsel with his officers on the course to be adopted in the mean time the miserable captive never ceased begging pardon and imploring to be delivered on the generous boldheart's proposal it was at length resolved that he should not be cooked but should be allowed to remain raw on two conditions namely       1 that he should never under any circumstances presume to teach      any boy any thing any more       2 that if taken back to england he should pass his life in      travelling to find out boys who wanted their exercises done and      should do their exercises for those boys for nothing and never say      a word about it  drawing his sword from its sheath boldheart swore him to these conditions on its shining blade the prisoner wept bitterly and appeared acutely to feel the errors of his past career  the captain then ordered his boat's crew to make ready for a volley and after firing to re-load quickly and expect a score or two on ye to go head over heels murmured william boozey for i'm a looking at ye with those words the derisive though deadly william took a good aim  fire  the ringing voice of boldheart was lost in the report of the guns and the screeching of the savages volley after volley awakened the numerous echoes hundreds of savages were killed hundreds wounded and thousands ran howling into the woods the latin-grammar-master had a spare night-cap lent him and a longtail coat which he wore hind side before he presented a ludicrous though pitiable appearance and serve him right  [illustration  the latin-grammar-master had a spare nightcap lent him and a longtail coat which he wore hind side before]  [illustration  ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced  by the uncouth though agile william]  we now find captain boldheart with this rescued wretch on board standing off for other islands at one of these not a cannibal island but a pork and vegetable one he married only in fun on his part the king's daughter here he rested some time receiving from the natives great quantities of precious stones gold dust elephants' teeth and sandal wood and getting very rich this too though he almost every day made presents of enormous value to his men  the ship being at length as full as she could hold of all sorts of valuable things boldheart gave orders to weigh the anchor and turn the beauty's head towards england these orders were obeyed with three cheers and ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced on deck by the uncouth though agile william  we next find captain boldheart about three leagues off madeira surveying through his spy-glass a stranger of suspicious appearance making sail towards him on his firing a gun ahead of her to bring her to she ran up a flag which he instantly recognized as the flag from the mast in the back-garden at home  [illustration  married the chief's daughter]  inferring from this that his father had put to sea to seek his long-lost son the captain sent his own boat on board the stranger to inquire if this was so and if so whether his father's intentions were strictly honourable the boat came back with a present of greens and fresh meat and reported that the stranger was the family of twelve hundred tons and had not only the captain's father on board but also his mother with the majority of his aunts and uncles and all his cousins it was further reported to boldheart that the whole of these relations had expressed themselves in a becoming manner and were anxious to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit he had done them boldheart at once invited them to breakfast next morning on board the beauty and gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all day  it was in the course of the night that the captain discovered the hopelessness of reclaiming the latin-grammar-master that thankless traitor was found out as the two ships lay near each other communicating with the family by signals and offering to give up boldheart he was hanged at the yard-arm the first thing in the morning after having it impressively pointed out to him by boldheart that this was what spiters came to  the meeting between the captain and his parents was attended with tears his uncles and aunts would have attended their meeting with tears too but he wasn't going to stand that his cousins were very much astonished by the size of his ship and the discipline of his men and were greatly overcome by the splendour of his uniform he kindly conducted them round the vessel and pointed out every thing worthy of notice he also fired his hundred guns and found it amusing to witness their alarm  the entertainment surpassed everything ever seen on board ship and lasted from ten in the morning until seven the next morning only one disagreeable incident occurred captain boldheart found himself obliged to put his cousin tom in irons for being disrespectful on the boy's promising amendment however he was humanely released after a few hours' close confinement  boldheart now took his mother down into the great cabin and asked after the young lady with whom it was well known to the world he was in love his mother replied that the object of his affections was then at school at margate for the benefit of sea-bathing it was the month of september but that she feared the young lady's friends were still opposed to the union boldheart at once resolved if necessary to bombard the town  taking the command of his ship with this intention and putting all but fighting men on board the family with orders to that vessel to keep in company boldheart soon anchored in margate roads here he went ashore well-armed and attended by his boat's crew at their head the faithful though ferocious william and demanded to see the mayor who came out of his office  dost know the name of yon ship mayor asked boldheart fiercely  [illustration  dost know the name of yon ship mayor]  [illustration  standing sentry over him]  no said the mayor rubbing his eyes which he could scarce believe when he saw the goodly vessel riding at anchor  she is named the beauty said the captain  hah exclaimed the mayor with a start and you then are captain boldheart  the same  a pause ensued the mayor trembled  now mayor said the captain choose help me to my bride or be bombarded  the mayor begged for two hours' grace in which to make inquiries respecting the young lady boldheart accorded him but one and during that one placed william boozey sentry over him with a drawn sword and instructions to accompany him wherever he went and to run him through the body if he showed a sign of playing false  at the end of the hour the mayor re-appeared more dead than alive closely waited on by boozey more alive than dead  [illustration  his lovely bride came forth]  captain said the mayor i have ascertained that the young lady is going to bathe even now she waits her turn for a machine the tide is low though rising i in one of our town-boats shall not be suspected when she comes forth in her bathing-dress into the shallow water from behind the hood of the machine my boat shall intercept her and prevent her return do you the rest  mayor returned capt boldheart thou hast saved thy town  the captain then signalled his boat to take him off and steering her himself ordered her crew to row towards the bathing-ground and there to rest upon their oars all happened as had been arranged his lovely bride came forth the mayor glided in behind her she became confused and had floated out of her depth when with one skilful touch of the rudder and one quivering stroke from the boat's crew her adoring boldheart held her in his strong arms there her shrieks of terror were changed to cries of joy  before the beauty could get under weigh the hoisting of all the flags in the town and harbour and the ringing of all the bells announced to the brave boldheart that he had nothing to fear he therefore determined to be married on the spot and signalled for a clergyman and clerk who came off promptly in a sailing-boat named the skylark another great entertainment was then given on board the beauty in the midst of which the mayor was called out by a messenger he returned with the news that government had sent down to know whether captain boldheart in acknowledgment of the great services he had done his country by being a pirate would consent to be made a lieutenant-colonel for himself he would have spurned the worthless boon but his bride wished it and he consented  only one thing further happened before the good ship family was dismissed with rich presents to all on board it is painful to record but such is human nature in some cousins that captain boldheart's unmannerly cousin tom was actually tied up to receive three dozen with a rope's end for cheekyness and making games when captain boldheart's lady begged for him and he was spared the beauty then refitted and the captain and his bride departed for the indian ocean to enjoy themselves for

redforth's waistcoat-pocket to announce our nuptials it flew right up when it went off and turned over next day lieutenant-colonel robin redforth was united with similar ceremonies to alice rainbird this time the cannon bust with a most terrific explosion and made a puppy bark  my peerless bride was at the period of which we now treat in captivity at miss grimmer's drowvey and grimmer is the partnership and opinion is divided which is the greatest beast the lovely bride of the colonel was also immured in the dungeons of the same establishment a vow was entered into between the colonel and myself that we would cut them out on the following wednesday when walking two and two  under the desperate circumstances of the case the active brain of the colonel combining with his lawless pursuit he is a pirate suggested an attack with fireworks this however from motives of humanity was abandoned as too expensive  lightly armed with a paper-knife buttoned up under his jacket and waving the dreaded black flag at the end of a cane the colonel took command of me at 2 pm on the eventful and appointed day he had drawn out the plan of attack on a piece of paper which was rolled up round a hoop-stick he showed it to me my position and my full-length portrait but my real ears don't stick out horizontal was behind a corner-lamp-post with written orders to remain there till i should see miss drowvey fall the drowvey who was to fall was the one in spectacles not the one with the large lavender bonnet at that signal i was to rush forth seize my bride and fight my way to the lane there a junction would be effected between myself and the colonel and putting our brides behind us between ourselves and the palings we were to conquer or die    [illustration  waving his black flag the colonel attacked]  the enemy appeared approached waving his black flag the colonel attacked confusion ensued anxiously i awaited my signal but my signal came not so far from falling the hated drowvey in spectacles appeared to me to have muffled the colonel's head in his outlawed banner and to be pitching into him with a parasol the one in the lavender bonnet also performed prodigies of valour with her fists on his back seeing that all was for the moment lost i fought my desperate way hand to hand to the lane through taking the back road i was so fortunate as to meet nobody and arrived there uninterrupted    it seemed an age ere the colonel joined me he had been to the jobbing-tailor's to be sewn up in several places and attributed our defeat to the refusal of the detested drowvey to fall finding her so obstinate he had said to her in a loud voice die recreant but had found her no more open to reason on that point than the other  my blooming bride appeared accompanied by the colonel's bride at the dancing-school next day what was her face averted from me hah even so with a look of scorn she put into my hand a bit of paper and took another partner on the paper was pencilled heavens can i write the word is my husband a cow  [illustration  sewn up in several places]  in the first bewilderment of my heated brain i tried to think what slanderer could have traced my family to the ignoble animal mentioned above vain were my endeavours at the end of that dance i whispered the colonel to come into the cloak-room and i showed him the note    there is a syllable wanting said he with a gloomy brow  hah what syllable was my inquiry  she asks can she write the word and no you see she couldn't said the colonel pointing out the passage  and the word was said i  cow cow coward hissed the pirate-colonel in my ear and gave me back the note  feeling that i must for ever tread the earth a branded boy person i mean or that i must clear up my honour i demanded to be tried by a court-martial the colonel admitted my right to be tried some difficulty was found in composing the court on account of the emperor of france's aunt refusing to let him come out he was to be the president 'ere yet we had appointed a substitute he made his escape over the back wall and stood among us a free monarch  [illustration  the court was held on the grass by the pond]  the court was held on the grass by the pond i recognised in a certain admiral among my judges my deadliest foe a cocoa-nut had given rise to language that i could not brook but confiding in my innocence and also in the knowledge that the president of the united states who sat next him owed me a knife i braced myself for the ordeal  [illustration  two executioners with pinafores reversed]  it was a solemn spectacle that court two executioners with pinafores reversed led me in under the shade of an umbrella i perceived my bride supported by the bride of the pirate-colonel the president having reproved a little female ensign for tittering on a matter of life or death called upon me to plead coward or no coward guilty or not guilty i pleaded in a firm tone no coward and not guilty the little female ensign being again reproved by the president for misconduct mutinied left the court and threw stones  my implacable enemy the admiral conducted the case against me the colonel's bride was called to prove that i had remained behind the corner-lamp-post during the engagement i might have been spared the anguish of my own bride's being also made a witness to the same point but the admiral knew where to wound me be still my soul no matter the colonel was then brought forward with his evidence  it was for this point that i had saved myself up as the turning-point of my case shaking myself free of my guards who had no business to hold me the stupids unless i was found guilty i asked the colonel what he considered the first duty of a soldier 'ere he could reply the president of the united states rose and informed the court that my foe the admiral had suggested bravery and that prompting a witness wasn't fair the president of the court immediately ordered the admiral's mouth to be filled with leaves and tied up with string i had the satisfaction of seeing the sentence carried into effect before the proceedings went further  i then took a paper from my trousers-pocket and asked  what do you consider colonel redforth the first duty of a soldier is it obedience  it is said the colonel  is that paper please to look at it in your hand  it is said the colonel  is it a military sketch  it is said the colonel  of an engagement  quite so said the colonel  of the late engagement  of the late engagement  please to describe it and then hand it to the president of the court  from that triumphant moment my sufferings and my dangers were at an end the court rose up and jumped on discovering that i had strictly obeyed orders my foe the admiral who though muzzled was malignant yet contrived to suggest that i was dishonoured by having quitted the field but the colonel himself had done as much and gave his opinion upon his word and honour as a pirate that when all was lost the field might be quitted without disgrace i was going to be found no coward and not guilty and my blooming bride was going to be publicly restored to my arms in a procession when an unlooked-for event disturbed the general rejoicing this was no other than the emperor of france's aunt catching hold of his hair the proceedings abruptly terminated and the court tumultuously dissolved  [illustration  the pirate-colonel with his bride and yesterday's gallant prisoner with his bride]  it was when the shades of the next evening but one were beginning to fall 'ere yet the

gallant prisoner with his bride  on the beauteous faces of the nymphs dejection sat enthroned all four reclined under the willow for some minutes without speaking till at length the bride of the colonel poutingly observed it's of no use pretending any more and we had better give it up  hah exclaimed the pirate pretending  don't go on like that you worry me returned his bride  the lovely bride of tinkling echoed the incredible declaration the two warriors exchanged stoney glances  if said the bride of the pirate-colonel grown-up people won't do what they ought to do and will put us out what comes of our pretending  we only get into scrapes said the bride of tinkling  you know very well pursued the colonel's bride that miss drowvey wouldn't fall you complained of it yourself and you know how disgracefully the court-martial ended as to our marriage would my people acknowledge it at home  or would my people acknowledge ours said the bride of tinkling  again the two warriors exchanged stoney glances  if you knocked at the door and claimed me after you were told to go away said the colonel's bride you would only have your hair pulled or your ears or your nose  if you persisted in ringing at the bell and claiming me said the bride of tinkling to that gentleman you would have things dropped on your head from the window over the handle or you would be played upon by the garden-engine  and at your own homes resumed the bride of the colonel it would be just as bad you would be sent to bed or something equally undignified again  how would you support us  the pirate-colonel replied in a courageous voice by rapine but his bride retorted suppose the grown-up people wouldn't be rapined then said the colonel they should pay the penalty in blood but suppose they should object retorted his bride and wouldn't pay the penalty in blood or anything else  a mournful silence ensued  then do you no longer love me alice asked the colonel  redforth i am ever thine returned his bride  then do you no longer love me nettie asked the present writer  tinkling i am ever thine returned my bride  we all four embraced let me not be misunderstood by the giddy the colonel embraced his own bride and i embraced mine but two times two make four  nettie and i said alice mournfully have been considering our position the grown-up people are too strong for us they make us ridiculous besides they have changed the times william tinkling's baby-brother was christened yesterday what took place was any king present answer william  i said no unless disguised as great-uncle chopper  any queen  there had been no queen that i knew of at our house there might have been one in the kitchen but i didn't think so or the servants would have mentioned it  any fairies  none that were visible  we had an idea among us i think said alice with a melancholy smile we four that miss grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy and would come in at the christening with her crutch-stick and give the child a bad gift was there anything of that sort answer william  [illustration  we had an idea among us  that miss grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy]  i said that ma had said afterwards and so she had that great-uncle chopper's gift was a shabby one but she hadn't said a bad one she had called it shabby electrotyped second-hand and below his income  it must be the grown-up people who have changed all this said alice we couldn't have changed it if we had been so inclined and we never should have been or perhaps miss grimmer is a wicked fairy after all and won't act up to it because the grown-up people have persuaded her not to either way they would make us ridiculous if we told them what we expected  tyrants muttered the pirate-colonel  nay my redforth said alice say not so call not names my redforth or they will apply to pa  let 'em said the colonel i don't care who's he  tinkling here undertook the perilous task of remonstrating with his lawless friend who consented to withdraw the moody expressions above quoted  what remains for us to do alice went on in her mild wise way we must educate we must pretend in a new manner we must wait  the colonel clenched his teeth four out in front and a piece off another and he had been twice dragged to the door of a dentist-despot but had escaped from his guards how educate how pretend in a new manner how wait  educate the grown-up people replied alice we part to-night yes redforth for the colonel tucked up his cuffs part to-night let us in these next holidays now going to begin throw our thoughts into something educational for the grown-up people hinting to them how things ought to be let us veil our meaning under a mask of romance[a] you i and nettie william tinkling being the plainest and quickest writer shall copy out is it agreed  the colonel answered sulkily i don't mind he then asked how about pretending  we will pretend said alice that we are children not that we are those grown-up people who won't help us out as they ought and who understand us so badly  the colonel still much dissatisfied growled how about waiting  we will wait answered little alice taking nettie's hand in hers and looking up to the sky we will wait ever constant and true till the times have got so changed as that everything helps us out and nothing makes us ridiculous and the fairies have come back we will wait ever constant and true till we are eighty ninety or one hundred and then the fairies will send us children and we will help them out poor pretty little creatures if they pretend ever so much    so we will dear said nettie ashford taking her round the waist with both arms and kissing her and now if my husband will go and buy some cherries for us i have got some money  in the friendliest manner i invited the colonel to go with me but he so far forgot himself as to acknowledge the invitation by kicking out behind and then lying down on his stomach on the grass pulling it up and chewing it when i came back however alice had nearly brought him out of his vexation and was soothing him by telling him how soon we should all be ninety  as we sat under the willow-tree and ate the cherries fair for alice shared them out we played at being ninety nettie complained that she had a bone in her old back and it made her hobble and alice sang a song in an old woman's way but it was very pretty and we were all merry at least i don't know about merry exactly but all comfortable  there was a most tremendous lot of cherries and alice always had with her some neat little bag or box or case to hold things in it that night was a tiny wine-glass so alice and nettie said they would make some cherry-wine to drink our love at parting  [illustration  there was a most tremendous lot of cherries]  each of us had a glassful and it was delicious and each of us drank the toast our love at parting the colonel drank his wine last and it got into my head directly that it got into his directly anyhow his eyes rolled immediately after he had turned the glass upside down and he took me on one side and proposed in a hoarse whisper that we should cut 'em out still  how did he mean i asked my lawless friend  cut our brides out said the colonel and then cut our way without going down a single turning bang to the spanish main  we might have tried it though i didn't think it would answer only we looked round and saw that there was nothing but moonlight under the willow-tree and that our pretty pretty wives were gone we burst out crying the colonel gave in second and came to first but he gave in strong  we were ashamed of our red eyes and hung about for half an hour to whiten them likewise a piece of chalk round the rims i doing the colonel's and he mine but afterwards found in the bedroom looking-glass not natural besides inflammation our conversation turned on being ninety the colonel told me he had a pair of boots that wanted soleing and heeling but he thought it hardly worth while to mention it to his father as he himself should so soon be ninety when he thought shoes would be more convenient the colonel also told me with his hand upon his hip that he felt himself already getting on in life and turning rheumatic and i told him the same and when they said at our house at supper they are always bothering about something that i stooped i felt so
